0.8 (unreleased)
----------------

- First major steps on ARMED echelle data reduction pipeline
- APF/Levy and Keck/HIRES implemented
- Updates to blaze function and slit profile fitting
- Initial support for multislit reduction
- Coadding; including docs; and tests
- Now requiring astropy >= v1.3
- raw_input handling for Python 3
- coadd handling of bad input
- coadd bug fix on obj name
- Init local (i.e. object dependent) parameters in coadding
- fix local background logic error in slit masking
- Refactor QA PDF to PNG+HTML
- Add nminima object finding
- Add new parameters for object finding, reduce specific detectors
- Add slit profile QA
- Begin writing header (e.g. RA/DEC) info to spec1d files
- Fix bug in applying BPM for finding slit edges
- Update Ginga hooks
- Enable archiving/loading sensitivity function
- Add new cosmic ray algorithms for coadding (especially pairs of
  spectra)
- Added support for TNG+Dolores long slit spectrograph
- Started removing cython code
- Update line detection algorithm
- Updated flexure and tilt tracing documentation
- Updated docs:added standards.rst, and make a small correction in using
  script pypit_setup in setup.rst
- Fixed travis
- Updated slit trace algorithm
- Improved arc line detection algorithm
- Added functionality for fully automated wavelength calibration with
  arclines
- Switched settings files to allow IRAF style data sections to be
  defined
- Allowed data sections to be extracted from header information
- Significant refactor of routines related to pypit_setup
- Various small improvements, primarly to handle Gemini/GMOS data [not
  yet fully supported in PYPIT]
- Removed majority of cython functionality
- Moved logging to be a package object using the main __init__.py file
- Begin to adhere to PEP8 (mostly)
- setup.py rewritten.  Modeled after
  https://github.com/sdss/marvin/blob/master/setup.py .  Added
  requirements.txt with the package versions required.
- Updates archeck
- Loads NIST arclines from arclines instead of PYPIT
- DEIMOS reduction!
- Bug fix for bspline with bkspace
- Enable loading a sensitivity function with YAML
- Allow for multiple detectors when using `reduce detnum`
- Moved all imports to the start of every file to catch and avoid
  circular imports, removed most `import ... as ...` constructs
- dummy_* removed from arutils as necessary and propagated changes to
  tests
- remove dependency of ararclines functions on slf
- change requirements for astropy to >=1.3.0 so that `overwrite` is
  valid
- include numba in requirements, but actually a requirement of arclines
