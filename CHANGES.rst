  downloading/caching needed data either at runtime or on demand.
- Save output wavelength calibration from `pypeit_identify` to the cache
  for direct reuse in data reduction.
- The `pypeit_identify` GUI can now toggle between linear and log

1.8.1 (23 Feb 2022)
-------------------

- various hotfixes
- Include preliminary support for fluxing with archived SensFunc files
  for DEIMOS.


1.8.0 (12 Feb 2022)
-------------------

- Fixed a bug about how `maskdef_offset` is assigned to each detector
- Changed default behavior for how PypeIt computes `maskdef_offset` for
  DEIMOS.  It now uses by default the stars in the alignment boxes.
- Introduces pypeit_parse_calib_id script
- Refactor manual extraction
- Fixed 2Dcoadd spec bugs for central wavelength dithers.
- GMOS doc updates
- Add 2D wavelength calibration image to MasterFlat output; include
  wavelength calibration in pypeit_chk_flat ginga display.
- Introduce mosaicing
    - `det` arguments can now be tuples with a list of detectors to
      combine into a mosaic.  Mosaics can now be defined in the pypeit
      file using `detnum`; e.g., `detnum=(1,2)` creates a mosaic of
      detectors 1 and 2.
    - The tuples must be one among an allowed set defined by each
      spectrograph class; see `gemini_gmos.py`.
    - `DETECTOR` extensions in output files can now be either a
      `DetectorContainer` object or a `Mosaic` object.  Both are now
      written using `astropy.table.Table` instances.  `Mosaic` objects
      just have more columns.
    - The `otype` of `DataContainer` data-model components can now be a
      tuple of `DataContainer` subclasses indicating that the component
      has an optional type.
    - Added the `one_row_table` class attribute to `DataContainer`,
      which will try to force all the elements of a datamodel into a
      binary table extension with a single row.
    - Started propagation of name changes from, e.g., `DET01` to
      `MSC01`, where the latter indicates the reduction uses the first
      mosaic option for the spectrograph.  Keys for master calibration
      frames are now, e.g., `A_1_DET01` instead of `A_1_01`.
    - Currently only implemented for `gemini_gmos`.
    - During processing, bias and dark images are left as separate
      detector images, whereas all other images are mosaiced for further
      processing.  This means that `RawImage` is now *always* 3D, where
      `PypeItImage` can be either 2D or 3D.
    - Added a `det_img` to `PypeItImage` datamodel to keep track of the
      parent detector for each pixel in a mosaic.
    - Added a `amp_img` to `PypeItImage` datamodel to keep track of the
      parent amplifier for each pixel in a mosaic; this is the result of
      mosaicing the `datasec_img` objects for each detector.
- Improve performance of L.A.Cosmic algorithm:
    - Switch to using ndimage.binary_dilation for growing masked regions
    - Switch to astropy convolution for Laplace convolution
    - Added faster block replication algorithm
    - Fix iteration logic
- Intermediate update to BPM.  Preference given to pulling this from the
  relevant `PypeItImage` calibration image instead of always building it
  from scratch.  That latter complicated things for mosaics.
- First steps toward more robust treatment of saturation.
- Dark counts used for calculating the shot noise now includes measured
  dark images if provided
- `PypeIt` file parameters can now parse sets of tuples; e.g.,
  `detnum=(1,2),(3,4)` should get parsed as `par['detnum'] = [(1,2),
  (3,4)]`.
- `PypeIt.select_detectors` has been moved to `Spectrograph`.
- Update for `LDT/DeVeny` including support for binned data,
  `use_header` for reading arc lamps used from frames, and `reid_arxiv`
  templates for three additional gratings.
- Slurps in and uses slitmask design for Keck/LRIS (limited usage)
- Hotfix for `gemini_gmos` mosaic tracing parameters
- Include sky model in 2nd pass of global sky subtraction (not for IR
  redux).
- Skymask is now computed also for the maskdef_extract objects.
- Added dedicated fwhm and boxcar_radius for maskdef_extract objects.
- Added pypeit_version to the pypeit file header.
- Set DEIMOS `find_fwhm` default to 0.8" in binned pixels.
- Added row-dependent pattern-noise calculation
- Improvements in `pypeit_coadd_2dspec`:
    - `maskdef_id` assigned to each slit
    - Assigning object's name, ra and dec to detected objects is now
      available
    - Force extract of undetected objects is now available
    - `maskdef_offset` can be use as offsets in the coadd
    - Coadding only a specific sets of slits is now possible with the
      parset `--only_slits`
    - If the user inputs a list of offsets, the weights can still be
      computed if a bright object is found, otherwise uniform weigths
      will be used
    - Fixed manual extraction bug
    - Various improvements in the flow of the code
    - spec1d*.txt is now produced also for coadd2d
- Scripts to explore the noise residuals in PypeIt
- Added Coadd2D HOWTO docs
    - Fixes a  bug in echelle object finding
    - Attempt to make the threshold computation for object finding more robust.
    - Fixed a bug in extraction for echelle spectrographs for IR reductions.
    - Tuned up preivious refactor of object finding and extraction classes.
    - Fixed a bug that was introduced in skymask definition.
    - Fixed a bug where negative objects were not being found for IR reductions of standard stars.
- Add template wavelength solution for soar_goodman_red 400_SYZY

1.7.0 (19 Nov 2021)
-------------------

- Introduces pypeit_parse_calib_id script
- Throw a warning if the chosen spectrograph has a header which does not
  match expectation
- Pypeit can now read (currently for Keck DEIMOS only) the list of arc
  lamps from the header and use it for wavelength calibration.
- Allow one to restrict the wavelength range of the arxiv template
- Fixed a bug in HolyGrail that did not allow for sigdetect and rms_wavelength to be
  slit dependent lists.
- Set DEIMOS FWHM default to 10 pixels
- Fixed a bug in HolyGrail that did not allow for sigdetect and
  rms_wavelength to be slit dependent lists.
- Improvements for MOSFIRE:
    - uses slitmask info in the slit edge tracing
    - associates RA, Dec and Object name to each extracted object
    - extracts undetected objects using the predicted position from
      slitmask info
    - uses dither offeset recorded in the header as default
      slitmask_offset, but the user can provide the maskdef_id of a slit
      with a bright object that can trace the offset.
    - improvements in the frame typing
- Implements new Mark4 detector for Keck/LRISr  (aka keck_lris_red_mark4)
- QL script for Keck/DEIMOS
- Implemented flux calibration and grating correction for datacubes.


1.6.0 (1 Oct 2021)
------------------

- Modifications to reduce header crashes
- Added `image_proc.rst` doc, which includes a table with the primary parameters
  that affect the control flow of the image processing.
- Added exptime and units to the PypeItImage data model.
- Made bias subtraction available to the dark image processing (i.e., if people
  request bias subtraction for darks, the bias needs to be passed).  Similarly,
  added dark to the buildimage calls in get_arc and get_tiltimage.
- Streamlining of the operations in pypeit.core.flat.flatfield.
- Digitization noise no longer added to readnoise calculation by default.
- Include "processing error" in error budget.  Accounts for, e.g., readnoise in
  dark image, etc.
- Include error calculation in overscan subtraction.  The error estimate is the
  standard error in the median, which will be an overestimate for the savgol
  method.
- Allow for pinhole and sky frames in buildimage_fromlist.
- In pypeit.images.rawimage.RawImage:
    - Conversion from ADU to counts is now the first step for all processing.
    - Added an `empirical_rn` parameter that allows the users to use the
      overscan region to estimate the detector readnoise for each image
      processed, and this estimation of the readnoise is now in its own method.
    - Subtraction of the dark is now done after the conversion of the image to
      counts.
    - Dark subtraction is now always performed using the tabulated values for
      each detector.  A warning is thrown if the dark frames are provided and
      the measured dark-current from a dark image is more than 50% different
      from the tabulated value.
    - Whether or not you add the shot noise and a noise floor to the variance
      image are now optional and controlled by parameters in ProcessImagesPar.
    - Changes to default ProcessImagesPar parameters: use_specillum = False for
      all frame types; shot_noise = False and noise_floor = 0 for biases; and
      use_overscan=True, use_biasimage=True, noise_floor=0., and mask_cr=True
      for darks.  Adjustments propagated to individual spectrographs.
    - BPM is not recalculated after applying the flat-field correction because
      it is not longer changed by that function.
    - The code keeps track of the image scaling via the flat-field correction,
      and propagates this to the noise model.
    - Compute and save a "base-level variance" that includes readnoise, dark
      current, and processing error as part of the PypeItImage datamodel.
    - Added `base_var` and `img_scale` to the datamodel of PypeItImage, as well
      as the noise_floor and shot_noise booleans.  All of these are used by
      pypeit.core.procimg.variance_model to construct the error model.
    - Added BADSCALE bit to ImageBitMask to track when flat-field corrections
      are <=0.
- Added `update_mask` and `select_flag` methods to PypeItImage as convenience
  methods used to update and extract information from the fullmask bitmask
  attribute.
- CombineImage now re-calculates the variance model using the stacked estimate
  of the counts instead of propagating the estimates from the individual
  exposures.
- CombineImage performs a masked median when combine_method = 'median', and the
  error is the standard error in the median.
- Simplifies stacking of bits in CombineImage.
- Calculation of the variance in processed images separated into two functions,
  pypeit.core.procimg.base_variance and pypeit.core.procimg.variance_model.
  These replace variance_frame.
- Added a "detectors" doc, and an automatically generated table with relevant
  detector parameters (including the dark current) used for instrument.
- Improved fidelity of bspline timing tests using timeit.
- Added inverse variance images to MasterBias and MasterDark frames so that they
  are available for re-use.

1.5.0 (11 Aug 2021)
-------------------

- Doc updates, including reorganization of the installation doc, fluxing and
  telluric docs, and automatic construction of the package dependencies.
- Add new pixelflat_min_wave parameter below which the mspixelflat is set to 1.
- Add `pypeit_install_telluric` and `pypeit_install_ql_masters` scripts.  The
  latter creates a symlink to the directory with the QL masters that will be
  used if the QL_MASTERS environmental variable does not exist.
- Improved `edgetrace.maskdesign_matching` to always return syncronized traces.
- Pypeit can now deal with dithered observations (only for DEIMOS for now), by
  finding the offset of the observed slitmask from the expected position in the design file.
- There are three options the user can use to find the slitmask offset: bright objects,
  selected slit, or alignment boxes.
- Pypeit run object finding for the alignment boxes but it does not extract them.
- `reduce.run` is now split in two methods: `run_objfind` and `run_extraction`.
- There are now 2 loops over the detectors in `pypeit.reduce_exposure`: the first
  one runs calibrations and object finding for all the detectors and the second one
  runs the extraction. In between the two loops, the slitmask offset is computed.
- A script (`get_telescope_offset`) to determine the telescope pointing offsets is
  added to `pypeit/spectrographs/keck_deimos.py`
- Improve SOAR Goodman fluxing


1.4.2 (06 Jul 2021)
-------------------

- Added a common base class for all scripts
- Script methods now included in Sphinx documentation
- Updated `pypeit.scripts.scriptbase.SmartFormatter` to enable wrapping
  long lines and specify lines with a fixed format using `F|`.
- Made `pypeit.core.telluric.Telluric` subclass from
  `pypeit.datamodel.DataContainer`, and added some basic unit tests.
  This led to some changes in the existing datamodel.
- Made `pypeit.sensfunc.SensFunc` subclass from
  `pypeit.datamodel.DataContainer`, and added some basic unit tests.
  This led to some changes in the existing datamodel.
- Allowed `pypeit.datamodel.DataContainer` parsing methods to used
  pseudonyms for HDU extension names and base classes to read the
  datamodels of subclasses.  Both added new keywords that default to
  previous behavior.
- Moved some functions to avoid circular imports
    - `pypeit.coadd1d.OneSpec` -> `pypeit.onespec.OneSpec`
    - `pypeit.core.coadd.get_wave_grid` ->
      `pypeit.core.wavecal.wvutils.get_wave_grid`
    - `pypeit.core.coadd.sensfunc_weights` ->
      `pypeit.sensfunc.sensfunc_weights`

- Method for slupring in a standard observed and reduced by WMKO


1.4.0 (23 Apr 2021)
-------------------

- Include a fix for when no edges are detected in `EdgeTraceSet` by
  adding the `bound_detector` parameter.  Most instruments have a
  default of `bound_detector = False` meaning that the code will skip
  processing any detector where no slit edges are found.  Some
  instuments set the default to be `bound_detector = True` because the
  slit edges always or often fall off the edge of the detector (i.e.,
  the detector is fully illuminated).  These instruments are currently
  `mmt_mmirs`, `mmt_bluechannel`, `not_alfosc`, and `shane_kast`; note
  that some `gemini_gmos` data in the DevSuite require
  `bound_detector=True`, as well.
- Improved wavelength template for DEIMOS gratings: 600ZD, 830G.
- Added new ArI, KrI, NeI, XeI arc lines.
- PypeIt can now compute arc line FWHM from the lines themselves. This
  is controlled by a new parset, ``fwhm_fromlines``, which is set to
  False by default, except for DEIMOS.
- Added a development document about the DEIMOS wavelength calibration.
- Limit reduction to detectors 3 and 7 when DEIMOS LVM mask is used
  (other detectors are empty)
- Add `pypeit_obslog` script that simple compiles and prints metadata
  from a set of fits files needed by pypeit to run.
- Change `PypeItSetup.from_file_root` to *require* the output path to
  write the vanilla pypeit file.  If no path is provided, the object is
  instatiated without creating any output.
- Fixed bug in sensitivity function code adressing issue #747. Revamped
  sensitivity function completely to compute zeropoints and throughput.
  Enhanced sensfunc.py QA.
- Added MOSFIRE QL script.
- Added support for VLT/SINFONI K 25mas (0.8x0.8 arcsec FOV) platescale

1.3.0 (13 Dec 2020)
-------------------

- DATE-OBS, UTC, AMPMODE, and MOSMODE added to metadata for DEIMOS, and
  the first three are now included in the auto-generated pypeit files.
- DEIMOS AMPMODE is now included in the list of metadata used to
  determine the DEIMOS configuration (setup).
- Frames ignored by
  `pypeit.metadata.PypeItMetaData.unique_configurations` used to
  establish the unique configurations are now set by
  `pypeit.spectrographs.spectrograph.Spectrograph.config_independent_frames`.
  These default to 'bias' and 'dark' frames.
- `pypeit.spectrographs.spectrograph.Spectrograph.config_independent_frames`
  can also return a *single* keyword selecting the metadata column used
  to match these frames to a given configuration.  For DEIMOS, this is
  used to match bias and dark frames to a configuration observed on the
  same date.  Currently these frames can only be set to a single
  configuration.
- Added `pypeit.metadata.PypeItMetaData.clean_configurations` that
  ignores frames that cannot be reduced by pypeit, as set by
  `pypeit.spectrographs.spectrograph.Spectrograph.valid_configuration_values`.
  For DEIMOS, this is used to ignore frames that are taken in
  direct-imaging mode or using anything except the B amplifier to read
  the data.  The ignored frames are removed from the metadata table
  (`fitstbl`).
- `update_docs` script now builds the html as well as the api rst files.
  It also prints a pass/fail comment.
- Added tests to `pypeit/tests/test_setups.py` to test that PypeIt
  correctly and automatically identifies frames from multiple DEIMOS
  configurations and that `pypeit.pypeitsetup.PypeItSetup` correctly
  produces separate pypeit files for each configuration.
- Added a development document reporting that PypeIt now satisfies the
  `PD-3` requirement Keck outlined for the DEIMOS PypeIt pipeline.
- Building the docs now dynamically generates an example pypeit and
  sorted file for inclusion in the PypeIt documentation.
- The setup block is now a simple listing of the keywords and values
  used to identify the instrument configuration.
- Refactor identify GUI and improve its docs
- Modest refactoring of templates.py
- Construction of wavelength arxiv files for DEIMOS 1200B and blue 1200G
- Pypeit now adds DEIMOS slits that are expected from the slitmask design
  but not found in the tracing process.
- PypeIt now flags as “BOXSLT” DEIMOS slits that are expected to be
  alignment boxes from slitmask design.

    - `pypeit.defs` is now deprecated
    - Removed usage from `pypeit.pypmsgs` and moved it to `run_pypeit.py`
    - Many Spectrograph instance attributes are now class attributes; in
      particular, previous instance attribute `spectrograph` is now `name`.
    - Added class attributes that set if the spectrograph is supported and any
      comments for the summary table.
    - `default_pypeit_par` is now a class method, which allows the name of the
      spectrograph to be defined in a single place
    - Valid spectrographs are no longer checked by
      `pypeit.par.pypeitpar.ReduxPar`.  This caused a circular import in the
      new strucuture.  The parameter `par['rdx']['spectrograph']` is virtually
      always checked by `load_spectrograph`, so I don't think this is a
      problem.
- Kastr 300 grating solutions
- Hotfix to include the solutions!
- Improved DEIMOS slitmask design matching
- Assign RA/DEC to DEIMOS extractions
- DEIMOS object RA, Dec, and name returned when running `pypeit_show_1d --list` and saved in

  has `minimum_slit_length < length < minimum_slit_length_sci` is
  considered a `BOXSLIT`, any slit with `length < minimum_slit_length`
  is considered a `SHORTSLIT`; the latter are always ignored.
- Introduced order matching code into EdgeTraceSet.
    - This helps fix an issue for GNIRS_10L caused by the orders
      shifting.
    - Introduces two paramters in `EdgeTraceSetPar` to assist the
      matching: `order_match` and `order_offset`

  for running the code under a screen; may need a better approach.
- Numerous doc and style fixes
- Add `master_type` to `MasterFrame` (and derived classes), which is
  used to set the name of the master frame output file.
- Significant edits to `MasterFrame` to streamline IO for derived
  classes.  Lead to significant changes to `Calibrations`.
- Main paths now set in `PypeIt`.
- Allow `connect_to_ginga` to start up the ginga viewer.
- Add a pytest `skipif` that checks if the Cooked directory exists in
  the dev-suite.  Use this to run the tests that only need the raw image
  data or don't need the dev-suite at all.

- Fix flexure crashing
- Change `pypeit.spectrographs.spectrograph.get_image_section` to
  *always* return the sections ordered spectral then spatial to match
  the PypeIt convention to match how binning is returned.  Propagated to
  get_datasec_img.
- Changed all functions related to binning to ensure that binning is
  always ordered spectral vs. spatial with the PypeIt convention that
  images have shape (nspec,nspat).  Includes associated documentation.
- Allow `pypeit.bitmask.BitMask` and `pypeit.par.parset.ParSet` to save
  and load from fits file headers.
- Force BitMask definitions in framematch.py and processimages.py to use
  and OrderedDict.  They need to be an OrderedDicts for now to ensure
  that the bits assigned to each key is always the same. As of python
  3.7, normal dict types are guaranteed to preserve insertion order as
  part of its data model. When/if we require python 3.7, we can remove
  this (and other) OrderedDict usage in favor of just a normal dict.
- Changed default for add and rm slits parameters.
- Doc improvements and removal of old, commented methods.
- Edited function that replaces bad columns in images and added tests.
- Added `pypeit.io` with routines to:

    - gzip compress a file
    - general parser to pull lists of items from fits headers
- Added metadata to `MasterFrame` objects written to fits files.
