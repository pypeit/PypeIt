Development Procedures and Guidelines
=====================================

.. contents:: Contents
    :depth: 1
    :local:

----

We encourage anyone to help us develop the ``PypeIt`` code base to better
suit your needs and to improve its algorithms.  If you do so, please
follow this list of procedures and guidelines.  In particular, please
note our :ref:`codeconduct`.

Installation
------------

If you plan to develop/alter the ``PypeIt`` code directly, you should 
install the code from source; see :ref:`developer_install`.

For simplicity in the discussion below, I refer to the directory with your
installation as ``$PYPEIT_DIR``.

Branches
--------

``PypeIt`` maintains two persistent branches:

 * ``release``: This is the primary stable version of the code.  Modulo any
   recent hotfixes, this is closest to the most recently tagged and released
   version.  Pull requests to this branch are only done before tagging a new
   release of the code or to perform critical bug hotfixes.  The release
   schedule is discussed during our bi-weekly development meetings.

 * ``develop``: This is the main development version of the code.  It should be
   stable enough to use, but it may contain experimental, unsupported code that
   is work in progress.

When editing the code, please create a new branch stemming from the ``develop``
branch.  You should also pull and merge in the most recent version of the
``release`` branch to make sure your new branch includes any very recent
hot-fixes.  On the command line, you can do this as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd $PYPEIT_DIR
    git checkout release
    git pull
    git checkout develop
    git pull
    git checkout -b my_new_feature
    git merge --no-ff release

.. note::

    In terms of the merge with the release branch, beware that you may need to
    start a new release version doc that reflects the jump in the version
    number.  This should only be necessary if your branch is the first one after
    a new tag is released.  See :ref:`changelog`.

Development Principles and Communication
----------------------------------------

The main thing to keep in mind when developing for ``PypeIt`` is that its
primary use is as an end-to-end reduction pipeline.  This has a few
implications:

 * By default, the execution of ``run_pypeit`` should continue either until a
   critical error is raised or the reduction is complete.  **No direct
   interaction with the code should be required at any point**.  ``PypeIt`` does
   have some interactive components, but these are executed only if specifically
   requested by command-line arguments or via separate scripts.

 * Any input needed from the user for your feature should be provided by
   :ref:`parameters` (preferred) or as a command-line argument.

 * When developing and debugging, you may need to interact with the code using
   `IPython.embed`_; however, these instances should be removed before
   performing a pull request.

 * The success or failure of any given procedure must be assessed via
   automatically generated quality-assessment figures (preferred) or via
   scripts that interact with the primary output files.

 * See :doc:`here <new_spectrograph>` for guidance on 
   adding a **new spectrograph** to the list of spectrograph data that
   ``PypeIt`` can reduce.

 * If your development includes adding a **new executable script**, see advice
   at :ref:`new_script`.

Feature development in ``PypeIt`` is unlikely to be fully independent of
other development activities.  Your feature will likely depend on or
influence the outcome of other modules during the data-reduction
process.  This leads to a few important guidelines:

 * Make sure that your branch is always up-to-date with the ``develop`` *and*
   ``release`` branches.  E.g.:

   .. code-block:: bash

        cd $PYPEIT_DIR
        git checkout release
        git pull
        git checkout develop
        git pull
        git checkout my_new_feature
        git merge --no-ff release
        git merge --no-ff develop

 * Consider the effects of simultaneous development efforts on your work
   and vice versa.  For example, if you're working on a specific module
   of the code that depends on the result/datamodel of the
   wavelength-calibration module, you should communicate this and find
   out if someone else is developing that module and how/if they're
   changing it.  Depending on the scale of those changes, development
   priorities may need to be worked out to minimize merge conflicts and
   the need to immediately rework/refactor new code.

 * When you're ready to, you can submit a PR at any time, but the core
   development team will need to discuss the merge order to ensure a smooth
   process.

Our primary means of **communication** for development is the `PypeIt developers
Slack <https://pypeit.slack.com>`_ and a biweekly telecon.  Contact `X
Prochaska`_ for Slack access and/or the relevant Zoom link.


.. _changelog:

Logging changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is important to log changes made to the code in a way that other developers
and eventually users can interpret.  In the past we have done this using the
single ``CHANGES.rst`` file; however, we now have version specific change logs
in the ``doc/releases`` directory.  In terms of development guidelines:

- Changes made to the code should be logged in the relevant development log.
  For example, all changes made *after* version 1.14.0 will be logged in a
  ``doc/release/1.14.1dev.rst`` file.  If the relevant file doesn't exist when
  you submit your PR, create it.

- Changes are expected to fall under a small set of broad categories, like
  improvements to performance for specific instruments, minor bug fixes, or
  datamodel changes (see previous release docs for examples).  When including
  your change, add it below the relevant heading; if no relevant heading
  exists, add a new one.

- Hotfixes merged directly to the ``release`` branch should *also be added to
  the relevant development log*.  I.e., these changes are not part of the
  released tag, even if they are in the "release" branch.  Again, if the
  relevant file doesn't exist when you perform the hotfix, create it in a way
  that it will get merged with the identical doc in the ``develop`` branch.

- When tagging, the development log will be renamed to the new tag version, and
  a new file should be created for the next development phase.  See
  :ref:`tagging`.

Testing the Code
----------------

``PypeIt`` performs extensive testing using the :ref:`dev-suite`; follow that
link for more details on executing the tests.  What follows describes how to add
new tests.

.. _dev-suite-tests:

Development Suite
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add new tests to the development suite

    #. Add the new data to shared Google Drive under ``RAW_DATA``. The tests are
       organized into setup directories under a directory named for the
       instrument.

    #. Add a new :ref:`pypeit_file` specific to this data to the `PypeIt
       Development Suite`_ repo under ``pypeit_files``. The file name must be
       lower case and named after the instrument and setup, for example:
       ``keck_deimos_1200g_m_7750.pypeit``.

    #. If desired, add any files for ``pypeit_sensfunc``, ``pypeit_flux_calib``,
       ``pypeit_coadd_1dspec``, ``pypeit_coadd_2dspec`` to the
       `PypeIt Development Suite`_ repo under ``sensfunc_files``,
       ``fluxing_files``, ``coadd1d_files``, ``coadd2d_files``, respectively.

    #. Edit the ``test_scripts/test_setups.py`` file in the `PypeIt Development
       Suite`_ to include the new setup among the tests to perform.  Follow the
       instructions at the top of that file.

    #. Run the full development test suite to completion. Once all tests pass,
       the ``test_priority_file`` will be updated with the new test. This file
       tells the test scripts what order to run the tests in for optimum CPU
       utilization.  Commit ``test_priority_list`` and any other files added to
       the dev-suite repository and submit a pull request.

The :ref:`dev-suite` also contains unit tests that require use of data in the
``RAW_DATA`` directory and "vet" tests that are set of unit tests that require
output files from PypeIt scripts.  The former typically test simple
functionality of the PypeIt code, whereas the latter (vet tests) check the
results of the PypeIt scripts against the expected performance/result.

.. _unit-tests:

Unit Tests (GitHub CI)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unit tests performed by GitHub continuous integration (CI) are located in the
``$PYPEIT_DIR/pypeit/tests`` directory.  To run them, make sure you have
`pytest`_ installed (this should be true if you followed the developer
installation procedure) and then:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd $PYPEIT_DIR
    pytest

If some tests fail, you can run an individual test, e.g. ``test_wvcalib.py``
with

.. code-block:: bash

    cd $PYPEIT_DIR
    pytest -s pypeit/tests/test_wvcalib.py

Note that the "-s" option allows you to insert interactive debugging commands
into the test, here ``test_wvcalib.py``, to help determine why the test is
failing.

.. warning::

    Running these tests may generate files that should be ignored.  **Please do
    not add these test files to the repository.**  We try to include clean-up as
    part of the tests, but these are not always caught.

Note also that the use of `pytest`_ requires the test dependencies to be
installed, e.g. via ``pip install -e .[test]``. It is also possible, and often
preferable, to run tests within their own isolated environments using `tox
<https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_. This provides the capability to
easily run tests against different versions of the various dependencies,
including different python versions. The available ``tox`` environments are
defined in ``$PYPEIT_DIR/tox.ini`` and can be listed by running ``tox -a``. To
run tests against the default dependencies using the default python, do:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd $PYPEIT_DIR
    tox -e test

To specify a python version, do something like:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd $PYPEIT_DIR
    tox -e py38-test

To test against, for example, the ``main`` branch for ``astropy`` on GitHub, you
can do:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd $PYPEIT_DIR
    tox -e py38-test-astropydev

Similar ``dev`` dependencies are configured for ``numpy``, ``ginga``, and
``linetools``, as well.

Unit tests included in the main PypeIt repo should *not* require large data
files.  Some files are kept in the repo for this purpose (see the
``pypeit/tests/files`` directory), but they should be minimized to keep the size
of the package distribution manageable.  Unit tests that require input data
files should instead be added to the `PypeIt Development Suite`_.

Workflow
--------

A typical ``PypeIt`` development workflow is as follows:

 * Create a new branch stemming from the ``develop`` branch (hot-fixes should
   instead branch from ``release``):

   .. code-block:: bash

        cd $PYPEIT_DIR
        git checkout release
        git pull
        git checkout develop
        git pull
        git checkout -b my_new_feature
        git merge --no-ff release

 * Develop and debug the feature

 * Run the unit tests, fix any failures, add new tests that test your new
   feature(s), and/or modify the tests to accommodate your new feature:

   .. code-block:: bash

        cd $PYPEIT_DIR
        pytest

   or preferably:

   .. code-block:: bash

        cd $PYPEIT_DIR
        tox -e test

 * Run the `Development Suite`_ and fix any failures:

   .. code-block:: bash

        cd $PYPEIT_DEV
        ./pypeit_test develop

   .. warning::

        The `Development Suite`_ is *extensive* and takes significant computing
        resources and time.  The PypeIt development team consistently executes
        these tests using cloud computing.  We recommend you ensure that your
        PypeIt branch successfully runs on either a specific instrument of
        interest or ``shane_kast_blue`` first, and then someone on the PypeIt
        development team can execute the tests in the cloud.  From the top-level
        directory of the `Development Suite`_, you can run all tests for
        ``shane_kast_blue`` as follows:

        .. code-block:: bash

            ./pypeit_test all -i shane_kast_blue

 * Edit the relevant development log (e.g.,
   ``$PYPEIT_DIR/doc/release/1.14.1dev.rst``) to include your key developments
   (see :ref:`changelog`) and update the `documentation`_.  You can compile the
   docs using the ``update_docs`` script (see below), which is just a simple
   convenience script for executing ``make clean ; make html`` in the ``doc``
   directory.

   .. code-block:: bash

        cd $PYPEIT_DIR
        ./update_docs

   *Any* warnings in the sphinx build of the docs *must* be fixed.  If you're
   having difficulty getting the right sphinx/rst incantation, ping the
   documentation channel in the `PypeIt Developers Slack
   <https://pypeit.slack.com>`__.  Also note that, even if no warnings are
   issued, it's useful to check that the documentation formats as you expect.
   After building the docs, you can open the ``doc/_build/html/index.html`` file
   to view and navigate through the documentation in its entirety.

 * Make sure all your edits are committed and pushed to the remote
   repository:

   .. code-block:: bash

        cd $PYPEIT_DIR
        git add -u
        git commit -m 'final prep for PR'
        git push

 * `Submit a Pull Request (PR)
   <https://github.com/pypeit/PypeIt/compare>`_. Unless otherwise
   requested, all PRs should be submitted to the ``develop`` branch.

.. note::

   The addition of new commits causes ``setuptools_scm`` to automatically
   increment the version based on the last tag that was pushed.  This will be of
   the form ``{next_version}.dev{distance}+{scm letter}{revision hash}``.  See
   the `setuptools_scm documentation <https://github.com/pypa/setuptools_scm>`_
   for more details.

Pull Request Acceptance Requirements
------------------------------------

Once you've submitted a pull request, two developers will review your PR and
provide comments on the code.  The minimum requirements for acceptance of a PR
are as follows:

 * If your PR introduces a new instrument (see :ref:`new_spec`) that ``PypeIt``
   is to support for the long term, this instrument *must* be added to the
   `Development Suite`_.  That means raw data should be added to the Google
   Drive (see :ref:`here <dev-suite>`) and relevant tests should be added to
   the ``$PYPEIT_DEV/pypeit_test`` script (via a PR to the `PypeIt Development
   Suite`_) such that the new instrument is included in list of instruments
   tested by executing ``./pypeit_test develop``.

 * The CI tests run by GitHub (see the Checks tab of the PR) on the remote
   repository must pass.

 * You (or someone running the tests on your behalf) must post a successful
   report resulting from your execution of the `Development Suite`_, which
   should look something like this:

   .. figure:: ../figures/tests_success.png

        Example posting of successful tests.

   For hotfixes, these tests can be circumvented at the discretion of
   the core developers in the cases where the hotfix is obviously
   correct.

 * All new methods and classes must be at least minimally documented.
   "Minimally documented" means that each method has a docstring that
   gives at least:
   
    #. a one sentence description of the purpose of the method,

    #. a complete list of the required and optional arguments and their meaning,
    
    #. a description of the returned objects, if there are any.
   
   Documentation is expected to adhere to `Sphinx`_ syntax; i.e., the docstrings
   should be `reStructuredText`_.  We accept both `Google-format docstrings`_
   and `Numpy-format docstrings`_.

 * The docstrings for any changes to existing methods that were altered
   must have been modified so that they are up-to-date and accurate.

 * Spurious commented code used for debugging or testing is fine, but
   please let us know if you want it to be kept by adding a relevant
   comment, something like ``# TODO: Keep this around for now``, at the
   beginning of the commented block.  Otherwise, we're likely to remove
   the commented code when we come across it.

 * "Unsupported code," that is code that is experimental and still work
   in progress, should be minimized as much as is reasonable.  The
   relevant code block should be clearly marked as experimental or WIP,
   and it should not be executed by the main ``PypeIt`` executable,
   ``run_pypeit``.

 * At least two reviewers must accept the code.

.. _tagging:

Tagging Protocol
----------------

The core development team will regularly tag "release" versions of the
repository.  Tagging a release version of the code is triggered anytime the
development branch of the code is merged into the ``release`` branch.  The
tagging process is as follows:

 * At biweekly ``PypeIt`` telecons or over the ``PypeIt`` developers Slack, the
   core development team will decide to merge the ``develop`` branch into
   ``release``.

 * A branch is created off of ``develop`` (typically called ``staged``) and then
   a `PR <https://github.com/pypeit/PypeIt/compare>`_ is issued to merge
   ``staged`` into ``release``.  This ``release...staged`` PR must meet the same
   `Pull Request Acceptance Requirements`_ when merging new branches into
   ``develop``.  Code review is expected to be limited (because all code changes
   will have been reviewed before pulling into ``develop``), but the result of
   the dev-suite tests must be shown and approved.  The reason for creating the
   new branch instead of a direct ``release...develop`` PR is to allow for the
   following updates to ``staged`` before merging (``develop`` is a protected
   branch and cannot be directly edited):

        * Fix any test failures.  As necessary, an accompanying :ref:`dev-suite`
          PR may be issued that includes test fixes required code changes.  If
          no code changes are required, a :ref:`dev-suite` PR should be issued
          that merges its ``develop`` branch directly into its ``main`` branch.

        * Make any final updates to the development log, and rename the log to
          the new tagged version (e.g., move ``1.14.1dev.rst`` to either
          ``1.14.1.rst`` or ``1.15.0.rst``).  The ``doc/whatsnew.rst`` should
          also be updated to reflect the file name change.

        * Update the documentation by executing ``cd doc ; make clean ; make
          html``, add any updated files, and correct any issued errors/warnings.

 * Once the ``release`` branch and the :ref:`dev-suite` ``main`` branch are
   updated, the dev-suite tests are re-run using these two branches.  These
   tests must pass before tagging.  Once they pass, the code is tagged as
   follows:
          
    .. code-block:: bash

        # Create a tag of the form X.Y.Z (using 1.14.0 here as an example).
        # The current autogenerated version is found in pypeit/version.py.
        cd $PYPEIT_DIR
        git checkout release
        git pull
        git tag 1.14.0

        # Push the new tag
        git push --tags

 * The tag is released for `pip`_ installation.

    .. code-block:: bash

        git checkout 1.14.0
        # Make sure you have the most recent version of twine installed
        pip install twine --upgrade
        # Construct the pip distribution
        python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
        # Test the upload
        twine upload --repository pypeit-test dist/*
        # Upload, this time it's for keeps
        twine upload --repository pypeit dist/*

    For the uploading, you need a ``~/.pypirc`` file that looks like this:

    .. code-block:: ini

        [distutils]
        index-servers =
            pypeit
            pypeit-test

        [pypeit]
        repository: https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/
        username = pypeit
        password = [ask for this]

        [pypeit-test]
        repository: https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
        username = pypeit
        password = [ask for this]

 * After a new version is uploaded to `pip`_, a new PR is automatically
   generated for the `conda-forge/pypeit-feedstock
   <https://github.com/conda-forge/pypeit-feedstock>`_ repository.  Follow the
   commit checklist there before merging that PR, which will trigger the release
   of a new pypeit package on conda-forge. For more information on how to
   manually update the conda-forge pypeit package, see :ref:`conda_forge`.

DOI
---

If we wish to generate a new DOI for the code, it is as simple as

 * Generate a `new release on GitHub
   <https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/about-releases>`_.

 * Update the DOI in the ``README.rst``
