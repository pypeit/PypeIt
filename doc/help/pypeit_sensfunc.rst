    Compute a sensitivity function
    
    positional arguments:
      spec1dfile            spec1d file for the standard that will be used to
                            compute the sensitivity function
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --algorithm {UVIS,IR}
                            Override the default algorithm for computing the
                            sensitivity function.  Note that it is not possible to
                            set --algorithm and simultaneously use a .sens file with
                            the --sens_file option. If you are using a .sens file,
                            set the algorithm there via:
                             
                                [sensfunc]
                                     algorithm = IR
                             
                            The algorithm options are:
                             
                            UVIS = Should be used for data with lambda < 7000A.  No
                            detailed model of telluric absorption but corrects for
                            atmospheric extinction.
                             
                            IR = Should be used for data with lambbda > 7000A.
                            Performs joint fit for sensitivity function and telluric
                            absorption using HITRAN models.
                             
      --multi MULTI         List of detector numbers to splice together for
                            instruments with multiple detectors arranged in the
                            spectral direction, e.g. --multi = '3,7'.  Note that it
                            is not possible to set --multi and simultaneously use a
                            .sens file with the --sens_file option.  If you are
                            using a .sens file, set the multi_spec_det param there
                            via:
                             
                                [sensfunc]
                                    multi_spec_det = 3,7
                             
      -o OUTFILE, --outfile OUTFILE
                            Output file for sensitivity function. If not specified,
                            the sensitivity function will be written out to a
                            standard filename in the current working directory, i.e.
                            if the standard spec1d file is named
                            spec1d_b24-Feige66_KASTb_foo.fits the sensfunc will be
                            written to sens_b24-Feige66_KASTb_foo.fits. A QA file
                            will also be written as
                            sens_spec1d_b24-Feige66_KASTb_foo_QA.pdf and a file
                            showing throughput plots to
                            sens_spec1d_b24-Feige66_KASTb_foo_throughput.pdf. The
                            same extensions for QA and throughput will be used if
                            outfile is provided but with .fits trimmed off if it is
                            in the filename.
      -s SENS_FILE, --sens_file SENS_FILE
                            Configuration file with sensitivity function parameters
      --debug               show debug plots?
      --par_outfile PAR_OUTFILE
                            Name of output file to save the parameters used by the
                            fit
      -v VERBOSITY, --verbosity VERBOSITY
                            Verbosity level between 0 [none] and 2 [all]. Default:
                            1. Level 2 writes a log with filename sensfunc_YYYYMMDD-
                            HHMM.log
