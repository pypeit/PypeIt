                            science object model used in the telluric fitting. The
                            options are:
                             
                            qso = For quasars. You might need to set redshift,
                            bal_wv_min_max in the tell file.
                             
                            star = For stars. You need to set star_type, star_ra,
                            star_dec, and star_mag in the tell_file.
                             
                            poly = For other type object, You might need to set
                            fit_wv_min_max, and norder in the tell_file.
