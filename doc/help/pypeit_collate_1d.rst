    positional arguments:
      input_file            (Optional) File for guiding the collate process.
                            Parameters in this file are overidden by the command

                              exclude_slit_trace_bm <slit types to exclude>
                              exclude_serendip      If set serendipitous objects are skipped.
                              match_using           Whether to match using "pixel" or
                                                    "ra/dec"
                              dry_run               If set the matches are displayed
                                                    without any processing
                              flux                  Flux calibrate using archived sensfuncs.
                              ignore_flux           Ignore any flux calibration information in
                                                    spec1d files.
                              wv_rms_thresh         If set, any objects with a wavelength rms > than the input
                                                    value are skipped, else all wavelength rms values are accepted.
                              refframe              Perform reference frame correction prior to coadding.
                                                    Options are ['observed', 'heliocentric', 'barycentric']. Defaults to None.
                             
                            spec1d read
                            <path to spec1d files, wildcards allowed>
                            ...
                            end
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --spec1d_files [SPEC1D_FILES ...]
                            One or more spec1d files to flux/coadd/archive. Can
                            contain wildcards
      --par_outfile PAR_OUTFILE
                            Output to save the parameters
      --outdir OUTDIR       The path where all coadded output files and report files
                            will be placed. Defaults to the current directory.
      --spec1d_outdir SPEC1D_OUTDIR
                            The path where all modified spec1d files are placed.
                            These are only created if flux calibration or refframe
                            correction are asked for. Defaults to overwriting
                            existing spec1ds.
      --tolerance TOLERANCE
                            The tolerance used when comparing the coordinates of
                            objects. If two objects are within this distance from
                            each other, they are considered the same object. If
                            match_using is 'ra/dec' (the default) this is an angular
                            distance. The defaults units are arcseconds but other
                            units supported by astropy.coordinates.Angle can be used
                            (`e.g.`, '0.003d' or '0h1m30s'). If match_using is
                            'pixel' this is a float.
      --match_using MATCH_USING
                            Determines how 1D spectra are matched as being the same
                            object. Must be either 'pixel' or 'ra/dec'.
      --dry_run             If set, the script will display the matching File and
                            Object Ids but will not flux, coadd or archive.
      --ignore_flux         If set, the script will only coadd non-fluxed spectra
                            even if flux data is present. Otherwise fluxed spectra
                            are coadded if all spec1ds have been fluxed calibrated.
      --flux                If set, the script will flux calibrate using archived
                            sensfuncs before coadding.
      --exclude_slit_bm EXCLUDE_SLIT_BM
                            A list of slit trace bitmask bits that should be
                            excluded. Comma separated.
      --exclude_serendip    Whether to exclude SERENDIP objects from collating.
      --wv_rms_thresh WV_RMS_THRESH
                            If set, any objects with a wavelength RMS > this value
                            are skipped, else all wavelength RMS values are
                            accepted.
      --refframe {observed,heliocentric,barycentric}
                            Perform reference frame correction prior to coadding.
                            Options are: observed, heliocentric, barycentric
      -v VERBOSITY, --verbosity VERBOSITY
                            Verbosity level between 0 [none] and 2 [all]. Default:
                            1. Level 2 writes a log with filename
                            collate_1d_YYYYMMDD-HHMM.log
