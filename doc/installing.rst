Installation
============

.. warning::

    **Apple Silicon users** have had issues in the past installing PypeIt using
    pip; however, we do not think this is an issue any longer.  If you have
    trouble installing PypeIt on your Apple machine following the pip
    installation instructions, first try following the `conda`_ instructions
    instead.  If that also fails, please `Submit an issue`_ and/or reach out to
    our user :ref:`community`.

Below, we provide detailed instructions for installing PypeIt.  For
troubleshooting, please consult the PypeIt :ref:`community` and/or `submit
an issue <https://github.com/pypeit/PypeIt/issues>`__ on GitHub.

User Installation
=================

.. _environment:

Setup a clean python environment
--------------------------------

Both methods discussed below for installing PypeIt (via `pip`_ or `conda`_)
also install or upgrade its :ref:`dependencies`.  For this reason, we highly
(!!) recommend you first set up a clean python environment in which to install
PypeIt.  This mitigates any possible dependency conflicts with other
packages you use.

You can setup a new python environment using `virtualenv`_:

.. code-block:: console

    virtualenv pypeit
    source pypeit/bin/activate

or `conda`_:

.. code-block:: console

    conda create -n pypeit python=3.11
    conda activate pypeit

See the `Virtualenv documentation <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/>`_
and/or `Managing Environments with Conda
<https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html>`_
for more details. See also `virtualenvwrapper
<https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ as an option for more
easily managing `virtualenv`_ environments. The `conda`_ installation method described below
creates an environment for you.

.. _installing-pip:

Install via ``pip``
-------------------

To install the latest release of PypeIt and its required dependencies, execute:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install pypeit

.. _optional-dependencies:

Optional Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PypeIt has a few optional dependencies that improve and/or expand functionality.

    - If you are generating datacubes (and performing an astrometric
      correction), you will also need the `scikit-image`_ package. It can be
      installed by including it in the optional dependencies, e.g.:

      .. code-block:: console

        pip install "pypeit[scikit-image]"

    - To take advantage of an interface that allows you to ingest PypeIt outputs
      into its ``Spectrum1D`` and ``SpectrumList`` objects (see
      :ref:`spec-1d-output`), you can include `specutils`_ in the installation
      like so:

      .. code-block:: console

        pip install "pypeit[specutils]"

.. note::

    Whether or not it is correct syntax to use the quotes in the commands above
    depends on your shell.  The above commands are specific to ZShell, whereas
    you don't need the quotes in Bash.  But, in any case, you should avoid
    copying these commands from your browser since the unicode for quotation
    marks may not be correct, leading to errors when they are directly pasted
    into a terminal window.

Upgrading to a new version via ``pip``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Upgrading PypeIt should simply be a matter of executing:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install pypeit --upgrade

If this causes problems (e.g., a new PypeIt script is unavailable or
you encounter script errors), first try uninstalling (e.g., ``pip uninstall pypeit``)
and then reinstalling.

.. warning::

    Whenever you upgrade PypeIt, beware that this may include changes to the
    output file data models.  These changes are not required to be
    backwards-compatible, meaning that, e.g., ``pypeit_show_2dspec`` may fault
    when trying to view ``spec2d*`` files produced with your existing PypeIt
    version after upgrading to a new version.  **The best approach is to always
    re-reduce data you're still working with anytime you update PypeIt.**

Install via ``conda``
---------------------

`conda`_ is a popular and widely-used package and environment manager. We
provide a yaml file that can be used to setup a conda environment called
``pypeit`` that contains ``pypeit`` and all of the required dependencies.
To use this:

    #. Download `environment.yml
       <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pypeit/PypeIt/release/environment.yml>`__.

    #. Create the conda environment and install ``pypeit`` into it:

        .. code-block:: console

            conda env create -f environment.yml

    #. Activate it:

        .. code-block:: console

            conda activate pypeit

    #. Verify that the new environment was installed correctly and contains ``pypeit``:

        .. code-block:: console

            conda env list

This environment should now be ready to use and contain the latest official
``pypeit`` release.

Upgrading to a new version via ``conda``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Upgrading PypeIt within your ``pypeit`` ``conda`` environment should simply be a
matter of executing:

.. code-block:: console

    conda update --all

If this causes problems (e.g., a new PypeIt script is unavailable or
you encounter script errors), simply remove the conda environment
(e.g., ``conda env remove pypeit``) and reinstall as above.

.. warning::

    Whenever you upgrade PypeIt, beware that this may include changes to the
    output file data models.  These changes are not required to be
    backwards-compatible, meaning that, e.g., ``pypeit_show_2dspec`` may fault
    when trying to view ``spec2d*`` files produced with your existing PypeIt
    version after upgrading to a new version.  **The best approach is to always
    re-reduce data you're still working with anytime you update PypeIt.**

.. _m1_macs:

User Installation on Apple Silicon-based Macs
---------------------------------------------

Both the `pip`_ and `conda`_ installation methods should be successful for Macs
that uses Apple Silicon processors.  The full Anaconda installers also now
include support for Apple Silicon.

Solutions/Recommendations/Feedback for these installation options are welcome;
please `Submit an issue`_.

----

.. _data_installation:

Additional Data
===============

Some data used by PypeIt are either not kept in the GitHub repository or distributed
via `pip`_ because of their large size.  These include:

 - Wavelength calibration template (``reid-arxiv``) files for all instruments,
 - Canned sensitivity function (``sensfunc``) files for Mauna Kea,
 - Sky transmission data (``skisim``) files,
 - Atmospheric model grids used for telluric correction and flux calibration, and
 - Canned data-reduction products used by quick-look scripts.

To ease the downloading and storing of these files, PypeIt now uses the ``astropy``
download/cache system to maintain copies of these files in a user-writeable location
that is independent of the PypeIt installation.  For most users, this will be
something like ``~/.pypeit/cache``, but is adjustable via ``astropy``'s `configuration
system <https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/config/index.html#astropy-config>`__.  By
default, PypeIt will download necessary files at runtime if they are not already
cached.

Because a fresh install of PypeIt does not contain all of the ancillary data that
might be required for data reduction, users planning to run the pipeline without an
internet connection will need to cache the necessary data files ahead of time.  To ease
this process, a script ``pypeit_cache_github_data`` is included.  For example, to
download the needed files for the ``keck_deimos`` spectrograph, you would execute:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pypeit_cache_github_data keck_deimos

Once cached, the data will be accessed by PypeIt without requiring an internet
connection.  This script will also download Atmospheric Model Grids specified in the
instrument-wide configuration, but may not catch configuration-specific ``telgridfile``
parameter specifications.  Before trying to run PypeIt offline, verify that any
necessary Atmospheric Model Grids are installed; if not, install them using the
instructions below.


.. _install_atmosphere:

Atmospheric Model Grids
-----------------------

Calculation of the sensitivity functions for IR instruments and general fitting
of telluric absorption uses a grid of model atmosphere spectra.  These model
grids range in size from 3.5-7.7 GB.  Each file provides model spectra for
atmospheric conditions specific to an observatory; however, a model grid is not
provided for all observatories with spectrographs supported by PypeIt.  If
you do not find models for your observatory, you can use the Maunakea model as
an approximation. It includes a large grid of different parameters and should be
good enough for most purposes.

**NOTE:** Instruments that anticipate needing
a telluric grid have its filename already included in the ``telgridfile`` `TelluricPar
keyword <https://pypeit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pypeit_par.html#telluricpar-keywords>`__.
The needed model grid will download automatically when required by the code, but
given the size of these files and your downlink speed, this may take some time.
To install the grid independent of a reduction, run the ``pypeit_install_telluric``
script, calling the filename of the grid required.  For example, if you needed the file
``TelFit_MaunaKea_3100_26100_R20000.fits``, you would execute:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pypeit_install_telluric TelFit_MaunaKea_3100_26100_R20000.fits

The downloaded file will exist in the PypeIt cache, and will persist through
upgrades of your installation via `pip`_ or `conda`_.  To force the update of a
telluric model grid file to the latest version, simply run ``pypeit_install_telluric``
with the ``--force_update`` option.

If you require a telluric grid that is not presently hosted in the cloud, the code will
instruct you to download the file separately from the `PypeIt dev-suite Google Drive`_.
Users may select any of the files in the Google Drive for their telluric correction,
download them separately, then install them using the ``--local`` option to
``pypeit_install_telluric``.


.. _devsuite-raw-data:

Raw Data
--------

Example raw data for all supported spectrographs are used in extensive testing
of the code base during development; see :ref:`dev-suite`.  General users should
not need access to these data; however, they may be useful for learning how to
use PypeIt before running it on your own data from the same instrument.
These data are stored in the ``RAW_DATA`` directory in the `PypeIt dev-suite
Google Drive`_, divided into subdirectories for each instrument and instrument
setup.  See also the `PypeIt Development Suite`_ GitHub repository, which
includes a :doc:`pypeit_file` for each instrument and setup used during
development testing.


Quick-Look Calibration Files
----------------------------

.. note::

    We continue to work on cleaner installation solutions for these data
    products, particularly for the quick-look calibration files.  In the
    meantime, note that you will likely need to re-run the data-specific
    installation scripts described below every time you upgrade your
    installation (via `pip`_ or `conda`_).

Some of the quick-look reductions provided by PypeIt require canned calibration
files to speed up the data-reduction process, as appropriate for a quick-look
result.  These files are hosted in the ``QL_CALIB`` directory in the `PypeIt
dev-suite Google Drive`_.

To install the quick-look calibration files:

    #. Right-click on the ``QL_CALIB`` folder in the `PypeIt dev-suite
       Google Drive`_ and select the "Download" option from the drop-down menu.
       This will download a zip file containing the full directory contents.
       Its current size (as of 22 July 2021) is about 35 MB.

    #. Run the ``pypeit_install_ql_calibs`` script.  E.g.:

        .. code-block:: console

            $ pypeit_install_ql_calibs --zip ~/Downloads/QL_CALIB-20210722T162355Z-001.zip --odir my_path

The ``pypeit_install_ql_calibs`` script will unzip the downloaded file in the
``my_path`` directory and create a symlink to the extracted directory in the
``pypeit/data/`` directory of your PypeIt installation.  The script can
automatically delete the zip file using the ``--rmzip`` option.  If you already
have the ``QL_CALIB`` directory, you can also use the script to simply create
the symlink using the ``--ql_path`` option.

.. warning::

    The installation script simply creates symlinks to the downloaded data.
    This means that if you move the original data, the symlinks will become
    broken **and you will need to rerun the installation script.**

.. _notes:

Important Package Notes
=======================

.. _interactive:

Interactive Tools
-----------------

Interactive tools in PypeIt are built using the `QT
<https://www.qt.io/>`_ windowing toolkit. The ``qtpy`` package is used to
provide an abstract interface to the two most widely used QT bindings for
Python (see :ref:`dependencies`):

* `pyqt <https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro>`_
* `PySide <https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python>`_

At least one of those bindings must be installed for the interative GUIs to
work. By default ``pypeit`` will install ``pyqt6``. Other backends can be used
by installing them manually via ``pip`` or ``conda`` and then setting the ``QT_API``
environment variable. See the `QtPy documentation <https://github.com/spyder-ide/qtpy>`_
for more details.

C code
------

Significant speed gains in PypeIt can be enabled via compilation of the C
versions of the b-spline fitting code. Compilation of the C code should happen
automatically when you install PypeIt.  However, you can check that the C
code was compiled successfully by running the ``pypeit_c_enabled`` script. What
you should see is:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pypeit_c_enabled
    Successfully imported bspline C utilities.

If no message is printed, the C code could not be imported.

Some notes if you have problems installing the C code:

    - the code will still run successfully by falling back to slower,
      pure-python implementations

    - to successfully compile the C code, you may need to update ``gcc`` and/or
      ``Xcode`` for Mac users

    - for some Mac users, you may also need to update your OS if you're using a
      particularly old version (e.g., 10.10 Yosemite)

Some of the C code uses `OpenMP <https://www.openmp.org/>`_ to parallelize loops
and take advantage of multiple cores/threads. This support is transparent and the code
will work single-threaded if OpenMP is not available. GCC supports OpenMP
out of the box, however the ``clang`` compiler that Apple's XCode provides does not. So
for optimal performance on Apple hardware, you will want to install GCC via ``homebrew``
or ``macports`` and specify its use when installing ``pypeit``. For example, if you installed
GCC 12.x via ``homebrew``, you would get ``pypeit`` to use it by doing, for example:

.. code-block:: console

    CC=gcc-12 pip install pypeit

Basically, ``pypeit`` checks the ``CC`` environment variable for what compiler to use so configure
that as needed to use your desired compiler. The ``pypeit_c_enabled`` script can be used to check if
your compiler has OpenMP support.

ginga Plugins
-------------

PypeIt requires the ``ginga`` viewer and uses at least one ``ginga`` plugin
to enable specific display functionality. No special considerations are needed
to have these plugins installed; however, you can check that they're enabled by
running the following script with the following result::

    $ pypeit_chk_plugins
    [INFO]    :: All required plugins found: SlitWavelength

If the check is unsuccessful, you will see an error message listing
the missing plugins. If you have a problem, please `submit an issue
<https://github.com/pypeit/PypeIt/issues>`__.

----

.. _dependencies:

Package Dependencies
====================

All PypeIt dependencies are installed along with the installation of
PypeIt itself.  Beware this means that packages in your current environment
may be updated depending on the PypeIt version requirements (which is why we
recommend you :ref:`environment` for PypeIt).  The current version
requirements for both users and developers are:

.. include:: include/dependencies_table.rst

Dependency Caveats
------------------

Some users have run into the following complications when installing the
PypeIt dependencies.  If you run into any more, please `submit an issue
<https://github.com/pypeit/PypeIt/issues>`__.

.. TODO: IS THIS FIRST ITEM STILL TRUE?

- At the moment, an implicit dependency on QT bindings remains because of our dependence on ``linetools``.

----

.. _developer_install:

Developer Installation
======================

We, of course, welcome and encourage community development of PypeIt.
Please see our :ref:`codeconduct` and the :ref:`development`.

Developer install via ``pip``
-----------------------------

Install pre-release or development versions of PypeIt directly from `GitHub
<https://github.com/pypeit/PypeIt>`_ using ``pip`` as follows. If you already
have a ``pypeit`` environment setup, run:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install --upgrade "git+https://github.com/pypeit/PypeIt#egg=pypeit"

If you're installing in a clean environment, be sure to include the optional
dependencies as well:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install --upgrade "git+https://github.com/pypeit/PypeIt#egg=pypeit"

These commands will install the default branch, ``release``. You can also
specify a different branch, such as the main ``develop`` branch:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install --upgrade "git+https://github.com/pypeit/PypeIt.git@develop#egg=pypeit"

Commit hashes, tag names, or git refs can also be specified; see the `VCS
Support documentation
<https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#vcs-support>`_ for details
and examples.

Developer install from source
-----------------------------

Developers doing code development will likely want to set up an "editable"
install that points to a locally checked out copy of the GitHub repository.  We
highly recommended using ``pip`` to install the repository and to
:ref:`environment` for code development.

To install from source (after setting up the python enviroment), first clone
(your fork of) the repository:

.. code-block:: console

    git clone https://github.com/pypeit/PypeIt.git

Then install the code, include the development dependencies:

.. code-block:: console

    cd PypeIt
    pip install -e ".[dev]"

An "editable" install means that any changes you make in the repository
directory tree will become immediately available the next time the code is
imported. Including the ``[dev]`` set of optional dependencies ensures that all
of the tools you need to test and build PypeIt are installed. (Again, note that
you may or may not need the quotes above depending on your shell, and that you
should avoid cutting and pasting these commands into a terminal window.)

Finally, you may want to add lines to your relevant shell configuration file
(e.g., ``.zshrc`` or ``.bashrc``) that activate the relevant environment
whenever you start up a new shell.  For example:

.. code-block:: console

    conda activate pypeit

Otherwise you will need to always type this command at the terminal prompt to
activate the pypeit environment.

----

.. _test_installation:

Test Your Installation
======================

Tagged versions of PypeIt are extensively tested before distribution.
However, it is worth testing that your installation has been successful, as
follows.

User Tests
----------

The most basic tests that PypeIt has been properly installed is to get the
help dialog for one of its main executables.  I.e., from a terminal widow, type:

.. code-block:: console

    run_pypeit -h

A second basic test is to try to import PypeIt from within a python session.
For example:

.. code-block:: console

    python
    >>> import pypeit

**To ensure that your installation of ``pyqt6`` works**,
you can try to use ``pypeit_show_1dspec`` on one of the test files distributed
with the package.  Below is a zshell command-line incantation (it's likely the
same in bash) that will locate a test spec1D file and attempt to use
:ref:`pypeit_show_1dspec` to show it:

.. code-block:: console

    python -c "from pkg_resources import resource_filename; print(resource_filename('pypeit', 'tests/files/spec1d_r153-J0025-0312_KASTr_20150123T025323.850.fits'))" | xargs -I {} pypeit_show_1dspec {}

If ``pyqt6`` or another Qt backend is correctly installed, this should show a test
spectrum from the Shane/KAST spectrograph.

Developer Tests
---------------

If you performed a developer installation by cloning the repository into a local
directory (e.g., ``~/PypeIt``), you can run the standard unit tests within the
PypeIt environment by executing:

.. code-block:: console

    cd ~/PypeIt
    pytest

.. TODO: WHO AMONG THE CORE DEVELOPERS USE TOX?  WE USE IT FOR CI TESTS, BUT
.. SHOULD WE BE RECOMMENDING IT FOR USERS?

To test within isolated environments and against different versions of various
dependencies, we recommend using ``tox``:

.. code-block:: console

    cd PypeIt
    tox -e test

or, e.g.:

.. code-block:: console

    tox -e test-astropydev

Run ``tox -a`` to see a list of available test environemts.

In either case, over 100 tests should pass, nearly 100 will be skipped and none
should fail. The skipped tests only run if the PypeIt development is installed
and configured; see :ref:`dev-suite`.
