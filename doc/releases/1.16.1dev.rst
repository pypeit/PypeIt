Version 1.16.1dev
=================

Installation Changes
--------------------

- Significant expansion of PypeIt's use of the cache system; see
  :ref:`data_installation`.  Important changes include that most cached files
  are now version dependent.  When upgrading to new versions of PypeIt, users
  should delete their cache and start fresh.

Dependency Changes
------------------

- Support added for numpy>=2.0.0; numpy<=2.0.0 should still be supported

Functionality/Performance Improvements and Additions
----------------------------------------------------

- Added the ``max_overlap`` parameter, which limits the set of new order traces
  added, to compensate for orders missed during automated edge-tracing, to those
  that have less than a given fractional overlap with adjacent orders.
- Added the possibility to decide if the extracted standard star spectrum should be
  used as a crutch for tracing the object in the science frame (before it was done as default).
  This is done by setting the parameter ``use_std_trace`` in FindObjPar.
- Now PypeIt can handle the case where "Standard star trace does not match the number of orders in the echelle data"
  both in `run_pypeit` and in `pypeit_coadd_1dspec`.

Instrument-specific Updates
---------------------------

- Updated X-Shooter detector gain and read noise to come from header, and
  updated plate scales to the most recent values from the manual.  Detailed
  changes are:
    - NIR arm:
        - Platescale updated from 0.197 to 0.245 arcsec/pixel
        - Dark current updated from 0. to 72. e-/pixel/hr
        - Gain updated from 2.12 to 2.29 e-/DN
    - VIS arm:
        - Platescale updated from an order-dependent value, to being 0.154
          arcsec/pixel for all orders
    - UVB arm:
        - Platescale updated from an order-dependent value, to being 0.164
          arcsec/pixel for all orders


Script Changes
--------------

- Modifications to the cache-related :ref:`install_scripts` to accommodate
  expansion of and changes to the cache system.
- Added ``pypeit_clean_cache`` script to facilitate both viewing and removing
  files in the cache.
- Changed the name of the multi-dimensional specdata to specdata_multi in pypeit_identify
  and improved the robustness of the saving dialog when calibrating single trace spectra.
- Fixed a read-in error for the high resolution A0V PHOENIX model.
- A new script, called `pypeit_extract_datacube`, allows 1D spectra of point
  sources to be extracted from datacubes.
- The sensitivity function is now generated outside of datacube generation.
- The `grating_corr` column is now used to select the correct grating
  correction file for each spec2d file when generating the datacube.
- Added the ``--extr`` parameter in the ``pypeit_sensfunc`` script (also as a SensFuncPar)
  to allow the user to specify the extraction method to use when computing the sensitivity
  function (before only optimal extraction was used).
- Added ``pypeit_chk_flexure`` script to check both spatial and spectral flexure applied to
  the reduced data.

Datamodel Changes
-----------------

Under-the-hood Improvements
---------------------------

- Introduced :class:`~pypeit.pypeitdata.PypeItDataPaths` to handle all
  interactions with the ``pypeit/data`` directory, which provides a unified
  interface for accessing on-disk and cached files.
- When adding missing orders, the full syncing procedure is no longer performed.
  The code now only checks that the edges are still synced after the missed
  orders are added.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix "The system cannot find the file specified" errors when installing on Windows.
- Fixed a fault caused when all frames in a pypeit file are identified as being
  part of ``all`` calibration groups.
- Allow for empty 2D wavecal solution in HDU extension of WaveCalib file
- Fixed a bug in the ginga display function, when the user doesn't provide the `trc_name` argument.
- Fix a MAJOR BUT SUBTLE bug in the use of ``numpy.argsort``. When using ``numpy.argsort``
  the parameter kind='stable' should be used to ensure that a sorting algorithm more robust
  than "quicksort" is used.
- Fix error "ValueError: setting an array element with a sequence. The requested
  array has an inhomogeneous shape after 1 dimensions..." occurring when unpacking
  the SpecObj spectrum but having an attribute of the SpecObj object that is None.
