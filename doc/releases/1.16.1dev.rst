Version 1.16.1dev
=================

Installation Changes
--------------------

- Significant expansion of PypeIt's use of the cache system; see
  :ref:`data_installation`.  Important changes include that most cached files
  are now version dependent.  When upgrading to new versions of PypeIt, users
  should delete their cache and start fresh.

Dependency Changes
------------------

- Support added for numpy>=2.0.0; numpy<=2.0.0 should still be supported

Functionality/Performance Improvements and Additions
----------------------------------------------------

Instrument-specific Updates
---------------------------
- Added support for the (decommissioned) AAT/UHRF instrument

Script Changes
--------------

- Modifications to the cache-related :ref:`install_scripts` to accommodate
  expansion of and changes to the cache system.
- Added ``pypeit_clean_cache`` script to facilitate both viewing and removing
  files in the cache.

- A new script, called `pypeit_extract_datacube`, allows 1D spectra of point
  sources to be extracted from datacubes.
- The sensitivity function is now generated outside of datacube generation.
- The `grating_corr` column is now used to select the correct grating
  correction file for each spec2d file when generating the datacube.

Datamodel Changes
-----------------

Under-the-hood Improvements
---------------------------

- Introduced :class:`~pypeit.pypeitdata.PypeItDataPaths` to handle all
  interactions with the ``pypeit/data`` directory, which provides a unified
  interface for accessing on-disk and cached files.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix "The system cannot find the file specified" errors when installing on Windows.
- Fixed a fault caused when all frames in a pypeit file are identified as being
  part of ``all`` calibration groups.
- Allow for empty 2D wavecal solution in HDU extension of WaveCalib file
