Version 1.14.1dev
=================

Dependency Changes
------------------

Functionality/Performance Improvements and Additions
----------------------------------------------------

- Started the development of instrument-specific scattered light removal. In this
  release, we only model KCWI/KCRM scattered light.
- Added support for Keck/KCRM RL data reduction.

Instrument-specific Updates
---------------------------

- Keck/KCWI and Keck/KCRM: Turned on polynomial correction for sky subtraction.

Script Changes
--------------

- When making datacubes, the user can select a separate frame to use for the sky subtraction.
  In this case, it is the processed data that will be used for sky subtraction (akin to nodding).

Datamodel Changes
-----------------

- A wavelength array is now stored for DataCube()

Under-the-hood Improvements
---------------------------

- The CoAdd3D code has been refactored into a series of core modules and PypeIt-specific routines.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixed bug associated with finding more than one file with the same name (but
  presumably different extensions).
- Fixed differential atmospheric refraction (DAR) correction bug. This bug affected
  datacubes combined using CoAdd3D(). Previously, the DAR was being computed, applied,
  and then later overwritten. The new routine is faster and more accurate.
- Fixed a bug associated with an incorrect date for the transition to the Mark4
  detector for Keck/LRIS RED.
