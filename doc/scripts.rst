.. _pypeit_scripts:

====================
Command-line Scripts
====================

PypeIt is packaged with several scripts that should have been installed directly
into your path (e.g. ``~/anaconda/bin``).  This document provides brief
summaries of each script and points to other pages with more information.

**If you are developing a new script, see** :ref:`new_script`.

.. warning::

    Whenever you upgrade PypeIt, beware that this may include changes to the
    output file data models.  These changes are not required to be
    backwards-compatible, meaning that, e.g., ``pypeit_show_2dspec`` may fault
    when trying to view ``spec2d*`` files produced with your existing PypeIt
    version after upgrading to a new version.  **The best approach is to always
    re-reduce data you're still working with anytime you update PypeIt.**

.. _install_scripts:

Installation Scripts
====================

To install PypeIt, see :ref:`installing`.  The following scripts are used to
install ancillary data not included in the baseline package distribution; see
:ref:`data_installation`.

pypeit_cache_github_data
------------------------

Because a fresh install of PypeIt does not contain all of the ancillary data
that might be required for data reduction, users planning to run the pipeline
without an internet connection will need to cache the necessary data files ahead
of time.  The ``pypeit_cache_github_data`` script eases this process.  For
example, to download the needed files for the ``keck_deimos`` spectrograph, you
would execute:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pypeit_cache_github_data keck_deimos

The script usage can be displayed by calling the script with the
``-h`` option:

.. include:: help/pypeit_cache_github_data.rst

pypeit_install_telluric
-----------------------

When needed, atmospheric model grids will be download automatically, but given
the size of these files and your downlink speed, this may take some time.  To
install the grid independent of a reduction, run the ``pypeit_install_telluric``
script, calling the filename of the grid required.  For example, if you needed
the file ``TelFit_MaunaKea_3100_26100_R200000.fits``, you would execute:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pypeit_install_telluric TelFit_MaunaKea_3100_26100_R200000.fits

The script usage can be displayed by calling the script with the
``-h`` option:

.. include:: help/pypeit_install_telluric.rst

pypeit_install_ql_calibs
------------------------

After downloading the ``QL_CALIB`` directory for use with the quick-look
scripts, this script "installs" the files by creating a symlink to it within the
PypeIt code base.

The script usage can be displayed by calling the script with the
``-h`` option:

.. include:: help/pypeit_install_ql_calibs.rst

pypeit_install_linelist
-----------------------

If an instrument-specific arc line list that is not already included in the
PypeIt repository is needed for a particular reduction, this script may
be used to install a user-generated line list file in the user's PypeIt cache.
See :ref:`user_linelists`.

The script usage can be displayed by calling the script with the ``-h`` option:

.. include:: help/pypeit_install_linelist.rst

pypeit_install_extinctfile
--------------------------

In the event of doing flux calibration for data from an observatory without an
included extinction file in the PypeIt repository, this script may be used to
install a user-supplied extinction file in the user's PypeIt cache.  See
:ref:`extinction_correction`.

The script usage can be displayed by calling the script with the ``-h`` option:

.. include:: help/pypeit_install_extinctfile.rst

pypeit_c_enabled
----------------

This is a simple script to check of the compiled C code used by PypeIt was
successfully installed.  The script takes no arguments and reports success if
the C libraries were successfully imported.

pypeit_chk_plugins
------------------

This is a simple script to check if all `ginga`_ plugins are successfully
installed.  The script takes no arguments.

pypeit_version
--------------

This simply prints the PypeIt version you have installed.

----

.. _scripts-core:

Core Processing Scripts
=======================

The core data processing scripts provided by PypeIt perform the standard data
reductions expected for all spectrographs.  These include basic image
processing, slit identification, wavelength calibration, flat-fielding,
sky-subtraction, and 1D object extraction.

.. _pypeit-chk-for-calibs:

pypeit_chk_for_calibs
---------------------

This script, which is similar to :ref:`pypeit_setup`, examines a set
of files for an input spectrograph and scans for the standard calibrations.
It raises warnings when these are not found.

The script usage can be displayed by calling the script with the
``-h`` option:

.. include:: help/pypeit_chk_for_calibs.rst

A typical call is:

.. code-block:: console

    pypeit_chk_calibs /PypeIt-development-suite/RAW_DATA/not_alfosc/grism4/ALDc2 -s not_alfosc

After a running stream of detailed notes, it prints a table of results
to the screen; e.g.:

.. code-block:: console

    setups pass     scifiles
    ------ -------- ---------------
         A False    ALDc200205.fits
      None True

pypeit_obslog
-------------

The ``pypeit_obslog`` script allows you to see a simple listing of the data
files in a given directory (or directories) and the metadata that PypeIt
will pull from their headers.  See :ref:`pypeit_obslog` for details.

pypeit_setup
------------

This is used to setup PypeIt for data reduction, including writing the
automatically generated ``pypeit`` file that you will likely need to edit by
hand.  See :ref:`pypeit_setup` for details.

run_pypeit
----------

This is the main executable for PypeIt for its core end-to-end data processing.
See :ref:`run-pypeit` for details.

pypeit_trace_edges
------------------

This isolates the slit-edge tracing to a stand-alone script that can be used to
troubleshoot issues before executing :ref:`run-pypeit`.  See
:ref:`pypeit_trace_edges`.

pypeit_compare_sky
------------------

You may find that the default sky models used for your spectrograph are not the
best suited for your data.  If so, this script allows you to plot a sky spectrum
extracted from your data against any of the sky models in the PypeIt archive;
see :ref:`alternate_sky_models`.

The script usage can be displayed by calling the script with the
``-h`` option:

.. include:: help/pypeit_compare_sky.rst

pypeit_qa_html
--------------

**Deprecated?**

This script constructs the QA html files.  This should be done by
default at the end of the :ref:`run-pypeit` execution.

The script usage can be displayed by calling the script with the
``-h`` option:

.. include:: help/pypeit_qa_html.rst

----

Quick-look Scripts
==================

PypeIt provides a script for faster, less robust data reductions for
quick-look assessments of the data.

pypeit_ql
---------

This script performs a boxcar (only) extraction of a long-
or multi-slit observation taken with one of PypeIt's
spectrographs; see :doc:`quicklook` for full details.  

The script usage can be displayed by calling the script with the
``-h`` option:

.. include:: help/pypeit_ql.rst

.. _further_proc_scripts:

Further Processing Scripts
==========================

PypeIt separates its :ref:`scripts-core` from subsequent processing steps, like
flux calibration and coadding.  The scripts that focus on the latter are as follows.

pypeit_sensfunc
---------------

Provided observations of a standard star, this script is used to create a
sensitivity function of your observations given the known fluxes of the observed
standard.  See :ref:`fluxing` and, specifically, :ref:`pypeit_sensfunc`.

The script usage can be displayed by calling the script with the
``-h`` option:

.. include:: help/pypeit_sensfunc.rst

pypeit_flux_setup
-----------------

.. TODO: Can someone please check/edit this?

Once you have a set of 1D object spectra and a sensitivity function, this script
helps you setup the necessary input file to perform the flux calibration and
telluric correction.  See :ref:`fluxing` (specifically,
:ref:`apply_fluxcal`), :doc:`coadd1d`, and :doc:`telluric` for details.

Note you will need to hand edit the files generated by this script:

    - Give sensfunc file name in the fluxing pypeit file
    - Give sensfunc file name in the coadding pypeit file
    - The coadding pypeit file includes all objects extracted from
      your main reduction, so you need to pick up the one you are
      interested in and remove all others in the coadding pypeit file
      (between coadd1d read and coadd1d end)

The script usage can be displayed by calling the script with the
``-h`` option:

.. include:: help/pypeit_flux_setup.rst

pypeit_flux_calib
-----------------

Once you have a set of 1D object spectra and a sensitivity function, this script
applies the flux calibration to your object spectra provided the necessary input
file.  See :ref:`fluxing` and, specifically, :ref:`apply_fluxcal`.

The MaskID will be populated only if the instrument includes
mask design (e.g. Keck/DEIMOS).  The Flags column describes
failure modes or reasons why the slit was not reduced.
*None* is the preferred state for a science slit.

pypeit_chk_wavecalib
--------------------

This script prints a set of simple wavelength calibration diagnostics for all of
the slits in a given :doc:`out_spec2D` or :doc:`calibrations/wvcalib`
file.  See :ref:`pypeit-chk-wavecalib` for more details.  Standard command-line

----

Interactive Scripts
===================

PypeIt provides a few interactive GUI scripts for specific parts of the data
reduction.  These are never run as a *part* of an execution of
:ref:`run-pypeit`.  Instead, they produce files or parameters that ensure
:ref:`run-pypeit` is successful.

pypeit_identify
---------------

This script provides an interactive GUI used for hands-on wavelength
calibration.  See :ref:`wave_calib` and, specifically, the
:ref:`wvcalib-byhand`.
