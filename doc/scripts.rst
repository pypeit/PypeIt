PypeIt scripts
**************

PypeIt is packaged with several scripts that should have
been installed directly into your path (e.g. ~/anaconda/bin).

Pipeline Scripts
++++++++++++++++


pypeit_chk_for_calibs
=====================

This script, which is similar to :ref:`pypeit-setup`, examines a set
of files for an input spectrograph and scans for the standard calibrations.
It raises warnings when these are not found.

The script usage can be displayed by calling the script with the
``-h`` option:

.. include:: help/pypeit_chk_for_calibs.rst

And a typical call::

    pypeit_chk_calibs /PypeIt-development-suite/RAW_DATA/not_alfosc/grism4/ALDc2 -s not_alfosc

After a running stream of detailed notes, it prints a table of results
to the screen::

    setups pass     scifiles
    ------ -------- ---------------
         A False ALDc200205.fits
      None True


.. _pypeit-setup:

pypeit_setup
============

This setups files for data reduction.  See :doc:`setup` for details

run_pypeit
==========

This is the main executable for PypeIt.  See :doc:`running` for details.

pypeit_view_fits
================

This is a wrapper to the Ginga image viewer.  It is a bit of a kludge
in that it writes a dummy tmp.fits file to the harddrive and sends
that into Ginga.  The dummy file is deleted afterwards.

The script usage can be displayed by calling the script with the
``-h`` option:

.. include:: help/pypeit_view_fits.rst


Data Processing Scripts
+++++++++++++++++++++++

pypeit_coadd_1dspec
===================

See :doc:`coadd1d` for further details.

Calibration Scripts
+++++++++++++++++++

pypeit_arcid_plot
=================

Generate a PDF plot from a MasterFrame_WaveCalib.json file.
This may be useful to ID lines in other data.

The script usage can be displayed by calling the script with the
``-h`` option:

.. include:: help/pypeit_arcid_plot.rst


pypeit_lowrdx_pixflat
=====================

Convert a LowRedux pixel flat into a PypeIt ready file.

The script usage can be displayed by calling the script with the
``-h`` option:

.. include:: help/pypeit_lowrdx_pixflat.rst

pypeit_chk_edges
================

Inspect the slit/order edges identified by PypeIt in a RC Ginga
window.

The script usage can be displayed by calling the script with the
``-h`` option:

.. include:: help/pypeit_chk_edges.rst


pypeit_chk_flats
================

Inspect the flat field images produced by PypeIt in a RC Ginga
window.  This includes the stacked 'raw' image, the pixel flat,
the illumination flat, and the flat model.

The script usage can be displayed by calling the script with the
``-h`` option:

.. include:: help/pypeit_chk_flats.rst

pypeit_flux_setup
=================

This sets up files for fluxing, coadding and telluric corrections.
Note the pypeit files generated by this scripts need your changes:

    - Give sensfunc file name in the fluxing pypeit file
    - Give sensfunc file name in the coadding pypeit file
    - The coadding pypeit file includes all objects extracted from
      your main reduction, so you need to pick up the one you are
      interested in and remove all others in the coadding pypeit file
      (between coadd1d read and coadd1d end)

See :doc:`fluxing`, :doc:`coadd1d`, and :doc:`telluric` for details.

The script usage can be displayed by calling the script with the
``-h`` option:

.. include:: help/pypeit_flux_setup.rst
