Outputs

PypeIt, despite a pipeline for data *reduction*, is capable of generating
an inordinate amount of data products.  These pages document the
various data products and the means to control the output.  A
full description of the naming system is described 
:doc:`here </naming>`.

Standard Products
=================

There are four standard types of output products generated by PypeIt.
These separate calibrations from spectra and QA plots.  Each type is
designated by a unique prefix in the filename:

===========  ===========  ===========
Output Type  Prefix       Description
===========  ===========  ===========
1D Spectra   spec1d-      1D arrays and meta data associated with extracted
                          1D spectra
Object info  objinfo-     ASCII table listing several object attributes
2D Spectra   spec2d-      2D arrays related to sources (e.g. sky-subtracted image)
Calibration  Master       Calibration images, fits, meta files, etc.
Reduction    N/A          Files that guide or describe the reduction
QA           variable     Quality assurance figures
