===================
Telluric correction
===================

Overview
========

Telluric correction is done after the main run of PypeIt, :doc:`fluxing` and
:doc:`coadd1d`.  The algorithm for deriving the best telluric model is pretty
similar with that used in the IR sensitivity function, which fits an user
defined model and telluric to a giant telluric grid. Please see :doc:`fluxing`
for more details.

Note that execution of ``pypeit_tellfit`` requires the atmospheric model grids
to be installed on your system.  See the instructions for installing these
:ref:`data_installation`.

pypeit_tellfit
==============

The primary script is called `pypeit_tellfit`_ which takes
an input file or arguments to guide the process. There are three
different object models for the fitting:

object models
-------------

The object model options are:
 - qso = for quasar or AGN.
 - star = for stellar object.
 - poly = can be used for any other object by solving polynomial model.

tellfit file
------------

The format of that file
is described in the *usage* of the script, i.e. type
*pypeit_tellfit -h*. Here are three examples for
three different object models ::

    # User-defined tellfit parameters for a quasar at redshift seven
    [tellfit]
         objmodel = qso
         redshift = 7.0
         bal_wv_min_max = 10825,12060

    OR

    # User-defined tellfit parameters for a A0 type star
    [tellfit]
         objmodel = star
         star_type = A0
         star_mag = 8.0

    OR

    # User-defined tellfit parameters for other type target
    [tellfit]
         objmodel = poly
         polyorder = 3
         fit_wv_min_max = 17000, 22000

See `Parameters`_ for details.


run
---

The script usage can be displayed by calling the script with the
``-h`` option:

.. include:: help/pypeit_tellfit.rst

Example script executions would be::

    pypeit_tellfit J1342_GNIRS.fits -t gemini_gnirs.tell

or::

    pypeit_tellfit J1342_GNIRS.fits --objmodel qso -r 7.52

A substantial set of output are printed to the screen, and
if successful the final spectrum is written to disk. Both
input and output file are in the standard coadd1d data model format.
See :doc:`coadd1d` for the current data model.



The parameters that guide the tellfit process are also written
to disk for your records. The default location is *telluric.par*.
You can choose another location with the `--par_outfile`_
option.

Command Line Options
--------------------

--objmodel
+++++++++++++
Your object model, either qso, star or poly.

--tell_grid OR -g
+++++++++++++++++

The full path for the telluric grid file. In case of spectrograph which
has defined the default grid, you do not need to set this argument.

--pca_file or -p
++++++++++++++++

The full path for the qso pca pickle file. Only used in the qso model.
The default is qso_pca_1200_3100.pckl which should be downloaded and put in
the pypeit telluric data folder.

--tell_file or -t
+++++++++++++++++

The tellfit parameter file.

--redshift or -r
++++++++++++++++

Redshift of your object.

--debug
+++++++

show debug plots if set.

--plot
++++++

show the final telluric corrected spectrum if set.

--par_outfile
+++++++++++++

File name for the tellfit parameters used in the fit.


Parameters
==========

qso model
---------

The two main parameters for a qso model are::

  redshift and bal_wv_min_max

redshift
++++++++

The redshift of your science object you want to correct telluric absorption

bal_wv_min_max
++++++++++++++

You can set a bal_wv_min_max if your quasar/AGN is a broad absorption line quasar.
It is a list with even float numbers in the format of (in case of two absorption troughs)::

    bal1_wave_min, bal1_wave_max, bal2_wave_min, bal2_wave_max

star model
----------

The main parameters for a star model are::

  star_type and star_mag

star_type
+++++++++

The spectra type of your star. If A0, it will use VEGA spectrum, otherwise will use a
Kurucz SED model.


star_mag
++++++++

V-band magnitude of your star.

poly model
----------

The main parameters for a poly model are::

  poly_order and fit_wv_min_max

poly_order
++++++++++
The polynomial order you want to use for modeling your object

fit_wv_min_max
++++++++++++++

You can specify a list of specific regions used for the fitting, if not
set it will simply use the whole spectrum. The format for this parameter
is exactly same with the `bal_wv_min_max`_ defined above.


Show your final telluric corrected spectrum
===========================================

The final spectrum may be viewed with the *lt_xspec* script which loads the data
and launches a GUI from the linetools package. e.g.::

    lt_xspec J1342_GNIRS_tellcorr.fits
