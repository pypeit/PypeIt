================
Coadd 2D Spectra
================

Overview
========

This document describes how to combine the 2D spectra from multiple exposures.
**For a worked examples,** see :doc:`tutorials/coadd2d_howto`.

Coadding must be done outside of the data reduction pipeline (:ref:`run-pypeit`);
i.e., PypeIt will *not* coadd your spectra as
part of the data reduction process, although it can
combine (without weighting) multiple exposures
during reductions (see :ref:`2d_combine`).

.. _coadd2d_file:

coadd2d file
============

The :ref:`pypeit-coadd-2dspec` script requires an
input file to guide the process.
The format of this type of :doc:`input_files`
includes a :ref:`parameter_block` (required)
and a :ref:`data_block` (required).

Here is an example for ``keck_lris_blue``:

.. code-block:: ini

    # User-defined execution parameters
    [rdx]
        spectrograph = keck_lris_blue
        detnum = 2
    [reduce]
        [[findobj]]
            snr_thresh=5.0

    # Data block
    spec2d read
    path /path/to/your/Science/folder
    filename
    spec2d_b170320_2083-c17_60L._LRISb_2017Mar20T055336.211.fits
    spec2d_b170320_2090-c17_60L._LRISb_2017Mar20T082144.525.fits
    spec2d_b170320_2084-c17_60L._LRISb_2017Mar20T062414.630.fits
    spec2d_b170320_2091-c17_60L._LRISb_2017Mar20T085223.894.fits
    spec2d end

The opening :ref:`parameter_block` sets information
and parameters for the reduction steps.
The ``spectrograph`` name is **required**.

See :ref:`coadd2dpar` for a list of the
options specific to 2D coadds, including :doc:`manual`. 

The :ref:`data_block` always begins and ends with ``spec2d read`` and ``spec2d end``, respectively.
It (optionally) provides the ``path``
to the :doc:`out_spec2D` files.
It then includes a (one column) table which
is a simple list of the :doc:`out_spec2D` files.

.. note::
    
    The inclusion of the line ``filename`` in the example above is **required**.
    This is the line providing the columns names for the data to follow and must
    be present, even if there is only one column.

You may also include file-specific options in the :ref:`data_block`
as additional columns.  See :ref:`data_block` for its formatting.

.. _pypeit_setup_coadd2d:

Setup script
------------

Similar to :ref:`pypeit_setup`, we provide a script that helps you construct the
required input file.  In this case, ``pypeit_setup_coadd2d`` helps you build the
required ``.coadd2d`` file.

The script usage can be displayed by calling the script with the
``-h`` option:

.. include:: help/pypeit_setup_coadd2d.rst

For example, assuming you have already executed :ref:`run-pypeit` on your data
using a pypeit file, you can construct the default coadd2d file(s) using:

.. code-block:: console

    pypeit_setup_coadd2d -f keck_lris_A.pypeit

This will produce one ``.coadd2d`` file per unique ``target`` in the pypeit file
with associated ``spec2d`` files in the output science directory.  The script
provides additional options that allow you to select specific objects/targets,
specify the method used to set the offsets and/or weights, specify the detectors
to coadd, and/or specify the slits that should be coadded.

.. _pypeit-coadd-2dspec:

pypeit_coadd_2dspec
===================

Once you have prepared a ``.coadd2d`` file, the primary script to execute is
``pypeit_coadd_2dspec``.

The script usage can be displayed by calling the script with the
``-h`` option:

.. include:: help/pypeit_coadd_2dspec.rst


options
-------

Here are commonly used options:

--show
++++++

Show a series of `matplotlib`_ plots to the screen.

--basename
++++++++++

Provides the basename for the spec1d and spec2d files.
If not provided, defaults to a portion of the input spec2d filenames.

--debug
+++++++

Provides additional debugging diagnostic plots compared to using ``--show``.

run
---

Then run the script:

.. code-block:: console

    pypeit_coadd_2dspec  FRB190711_XS.coadd2d --show

The parameters that guide the coadd process are also written to disk for your
records.  The default location is ``*_coadd2d.par``, where the wildcard should
contain the frames included and the target/object name.  You can choose another
location by modifying `--basename`_.

**For worked examples,** see :doc:`tutorials/coadd2d_howto`.

.. _coadd2d_datamodel:

Current Coadd2D Data Model
==========================

The outputs produced by :ref:`pypeit-coadd-2dspec` are identical to a standard
run of :ref:`run-pypeit`, except that the results are places in ``*_coadd``
directories.  See :doc:`out_spec1D` and :doc:`out_spec2D`.
