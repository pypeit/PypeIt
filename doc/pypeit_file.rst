PypeIt Reduction File
=====================

Overview
========

The primary file that dictates how ``PypeIt`` is executed and what
data it reduces is called the ``PypeIt`` reduction file. The name of
the file is expected to end with ``.pypeit``, and it has a specific
format that we discuss below. The ``PypeIt`` reduction file should
first be automatically generated using the :ref:`pypeit_setup`
script, but it can (and often will be) edited by the user.

This document provides guidance on modifying the file.

You must have a unique ``PypeIt`` file for each instrument
configuration, or "setup" (modulo detectors), which is often includes
the name of the slit mask design for relevant instruments. It is
possible that you will need to modify the settings for different
gratings, etc. It will also enable you to more easily customize the
associated calibration files to process.

File Format
===========

Here is an example PypeIt reduction file:

.. include:: include/shane_kast_blue_A.pypeit.rst

Parameter Block
---------------

At the top of the file is the parameter block which allows the user
to customize the parameters used to define how the data reduction
proceeds. The two lines shown in this example are the only 2 that are
required.

See `Edits to the Parameter Block`_ for common edits and also read
the :ref:`instr_par` relevant to the instrument used to collect your
data. Importantly, not that this provides the alterations that are
*always* made to the default parameters for the instrument in
question; i.e., these are *not* the parameters that you need to
include in your ``PypeIt`` reduction file. You only need to include
parameters in your ``PypeIt`` reduction file that you wish to change
from the instrument-specific defaults (or the global defaults in the
case that the instrument requires no change to the global default).

.. _setup_block:

Setup Block
-----------

The next block, beginning with line ``setup read``, describes the
instrument configuration. There should only be one setup shown (e.g.,
``Setup A``), and the parameters provided show the salient metadata
for that instrument configuration. **You should not edit any of
this**; it is informational and required. See :doc:`setup`.

Data Block
----------

Last is the data block, beginning with the line ``data read``, which
includes the path(s) to the raw data files and a table describing
those files. It is common to edit this table as described below.

The data block is a fixed-format table as written by the underlying
`astropy.table.Table`_ object used by :ref:`pypeit_setup`. The |
symbols need not align but the number per row must be equal.

.. warning::

    Users should always generate the ``PypeIt`` reduction file using
    the :ref:`pypeit_setup` script. However, you will often need to
    edit it because it is virtually impossible to create an automated
    procedure that will work in all cases. The ``PypeIt`` reduction
    file is the ultimate authority in terms of how the data is
    reduced. As such, you should understand how edits to this file
    work because these edits will override *anything* derived from
    the FITS headers!

Most :doc:`spectrographs` require at least one file with each
of the following :doc:`frametype`:

    - ``arc``: Wavelength calibration
    - ``trace``: Slit/order definition
    - ``pixelflat``: Flat fielding
    - ``science``: Science exposure

.. warning::

    The code will *not* run if your :doc:`pypeit_file` includes
    entries with ``None``. You must remove or modify those entries.

Edits to the Parameter Block
============================

:doc:`pypeit_par` provides the complete (and extensive) list of
parameters, the :ref:`instr_par`, and the instructions for
:ref:`change_par`.

Here are additional docs on common edits that ``PypeIt`` users make:

.. toctree::
   :caption: More reading
   :maxdepth: 1

   calibrations
   frametype
   bias_dark
   flat_fielding
   wave_calib
   slit_tracing
   object_finding
   reduction_tips


Edits to the Data Block
=======================

This section describes the common edits to the Data Block of the
``PypeIt`` file.

Add/Remove a File
-----------------

You can add/remove files from the data block.

To add a file, the only safe move is to copy in a line from the
``sorted`` file generated by :ref:`pypeit_setup`; see :doc:`setup`.
It needs to be formatted just like the others.

To remove a file, you may delete the line or comment it out by
pre-pending a `#`.

Here is yet another reminder to **not** include bad calibration
frames in the reduction (i.e., frames that you do not want to use,
frames with incorrectly identified types, or frames that could not be
automatically classified and have a ``None`` type). Check them now
and remove them if they are bad.

frametype
---------

The most common edit for a given data file is its :doc:`frametype`.
For almost all spectrographs supported by ``PypeIt``, you will need
at least one of these: ``arc``, ``tilt``, ``pixelflat``, ``trace``
and ``science``.

As you can see from the above example, a given file can have multiple
frametypes. Simply provide a comma-separated list, **without
spaces**.

Standard star exposures are very frequently mis-labeled as `science`
(and to a lesser extent, vice-versa). So keep an eye out for those.

near-IR
-------

One key difference is that you can and probably should make
modifications to enable A-B (or AA-BB or whatever) subtraction. See
:doc:`A-B_differencing` for a full discussion.
