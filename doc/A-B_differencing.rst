A-B image differencing
======================

Overview
========

PypeIt can reduce observations obtained using two or more nod
positions in an alternating pattern. In this case, the user needs to edit
the :ref:`pypeit_file` according to the desired reduction.
The good news is that the code has substantial flexibility,
the bad news is that setup is somewhat complex.

PypeIt file
===========

When running :ref:`pypeit_setup` for most near-IR spectrographs, the
:ref:`pypeit_file:Data Block` in the PypeIt file will include three extra 
parameters (``calib``, ``comb_id``, and ``bkg_id``), which should be edited 
according to the desired reduction. This can also
be obtained running :ref:`pypeit_setup` by adding the `-b` option.



Parameters
==========

The three additional columns (``calib``, ``comb_id``, and ``bkg_id``)
have the following meanings/definitions:

* ``calib`` assigns a calibration group ID to each frame. Calibration frames with the same calibration group number
  will be used to reduce a science frame with that calibration group number.
* ``comb_id`` represents a combination ID assigned to each science frame. Frames with the same value of ``comb_id``
  will be co-added together. Note that this is an unweighted co-add (and hence may not be necessarily be "optimal"
  in terms of S/N ratio).
* ``bkg_id`` represents a background ID assigned to each frame that will be used as a background image to be subtracted
  from the combined image created by co-adding all the frames with the same ``comb_id``.  Frames with the same value of
  ``bkg_id`` will be co-added together.



All of these should be assigned integer values (or ``all``, see below), and values less than or equal to 63.


Calibrations
============

Each calibration frame in the :ref:`pypeit_file:Data Block` should have the same ``calib`` ID value of
the science data that uses it, or be set to ``all`` if used by all of the science and standard frames in the pypeit
file.

For the calibration frames ``comb_id`` and ``bkg_id`` are irrelevant and their value
should be set to ``-1``.

Here is an example of a :ref:`pypeit_file:Data Block` for the ``illumflat``, ``pixelflat``, and ``trace`` frames::

    |          filename |                  frametype | ... | calib | comb_id | bkg_id |
    | m190627_0037.fits |  illumflat,pixelflat,trace | ... |   all |      -1 |     -1 |
    | m190627_0038.fits |  illumflat,pixelflat,trace | ... |   all |      -1 |     -1 |
    | m190627_0039.fits |  illumflat,pixelflat,trace | ... |   all |      -1 |     -1 |
    | m190627_0040.fits |  illumflat,pixelflat,trace | ... |   all |      -1 |     -1 |
    | m190627_0041.fits |  illumflat,pixelflat,trace | ... |   all |      -1 |     -1 |

For optical spectrographs, arc/tilt images would be treated similarly.

See below for near-IR spectrographs, where one typically derives the
wavelength and tilt solutions from sky lines in the science frames themselves.

Image Differencing
==================

The user needs to edit ``comb_id``, and ``bkg_id`` in order to
control how PypeIt combines and subtracts the spectroscopic data.

Here is an example of a portion of the :ref:`pypeit_file:Data Block` for the science files for a hypothetical
sequence which we could represent as an ABAB dither pattern::

    |          filename |        frametype | ... | calib | comb_id | bkg_id |
    | m190627_0001.fits | tilt,arc,science | ... |     0 |       1 |      2 |      # Position A
    | m190627_0002.fits | tilt,arc,science | ... |     1 |       2 |      1 |      # Position B
    | m190627_0003.fits | tilt,arc,science | ... |     2 |       3 |      4 |      # Position A
    | m190627_0004.fits | tilt,arc,science | ... |     3 |       4 |      3 |      # Position B

Note that given the values specified, PypeIt is going to compute tilts and arcs from each frame
individually, and it will use image `m190627_0002.fits` as the background to subtract from
image `m190627_0001.fits`, and similarly it will use `m190627_0001.fits` as the background to
subtract from image `m190627_0002.fits`. The values of the ``calib`` ID have no relation to the values for the
``comb_id``, and ``bkg_id``.

PypeIt always produces one set of reduced outputs (i.e. spec2d, spec1d, etc.) for every frame in the PypeIt file
which is labeled as a ``science`` in the PypeIt file.  In other words, the  "positive" and "negative" traces are not
combined into one output file, but rather only the "positive" traces are extracted (although the negative traces are
modeled). Thus for the example above, PypeIt produces four 2D spectral images::

    Science/spec2d-m190627_0001...fits      # m190627_0001.fits - m190627_0002.fits (A-B)
    Science/spec2d-m190627_0002...fits      # m190627_0002.fits - m190627_0001.fits (B-A)
    Science/spec2d-m190627_0003...fits      # m190627_0003.fits - m190627_0004.fits (A-B)
    Science/spec2d-m190627_0004...fits      # m190627_0004.fits - m190627_0003.fits (B-A)


If each frame has a unique ``comb_id`` (as in the example above) the images will *not* be combined before
the reduction.

Alternatively, frames with common values of ``comb_id`` can be co-added. In this case, a common ``bkg_id``
should be used for all frames to be subtracted from frames with common ``comb_id``.

Here is an example of the PypeIt file for combining frames which would represent an ABBA dither pattern where the user
wants to co-add the science frames and the background frames at the same dither position (i.e. AA-BB, and BB-AA)::

    |          filename |        frametype | ... | calib | comb_id | bkg_id |
    | m190627_0001.fits | tilt,arc,science | ... |     0 |      10 |     11 |       # Position A
    | m190627_0002.fits | tilt,arc,science | ... |     1 |      11 |     10 |       # Position B
    | m190627_0003.fits | tilt,arc,science | ... |     1 |      11 |     10 |       # Position B
    | m190627_0004.fits | tilt,arc,science | ... |     0 |      10 |     11 |       # Position A

We chose values of 10 and 11 for the  ``comb_id`` and ``bkg_id`` just to illustrate that these numbers are arbitrary.
Note also that we have assigned the science frames at the same dither position the same ``calib`` ID. This is the
sensible thing to do since those images are being combined and so better to also compute calibrations from the
combined images.

This produces only two spec2d (and spec1d) output images::

    Science/spec2d-m190627_0001...fits      # (m190627_0001+m190627_0004) - (m190627_0002+m190627_0003)  (AA-BB)
    Science/spec2d-m190627_0002...fits      # (m190627_0002+m190627_0003) - (m190627_0001+m190627_0004) (BB-AA)

Finally, let us consider science observations at two dither positions A and B with two exposures taken at each position,
i.e. an AABB dither pattern) but where the user wants to use an image at a third dither location C as the background
image. But since C is purely a background image, it should not be reduced::

    |          filename |        frametype | ... | calib | comb_id | bkg_id |
    | m190627_0001.fits | tilt,arc,science | ... |     0 |      10 |     12 |       # Position A
    | m190627_0002.fits | tilt,arc,science | ... |     0 |      10 |     12 |       # Position A
    | m190627_0003.fits | tilt,arc,science | ... |     1 |      11 |     12 |       # Position B
    | m190627_0004.fits | tilt,arc,science | ... |     1 |      11 |     12 |       # Position B
    | m190627_0005.fits |       background | ... |     2 |      12 |     -1 |       # Position C

This will combine the two A images for the purposes of computing arcs and tilts, and will also combine
them into one science frame. Likewise for the B images. The C image will be used as the background
for both sets of combined images.

The following spec2d (and spec1d) output images are generated::

    Science/spec2d-m190627_0001...fits      # m190627_0001+m190627_0002 - m190627_0005  (AA-C)
    Science/spec2d-m190627_0002...fits      # m190627_0003+m190627_0004 - m190627_0005  (BB-C)

Note that there is no output for image C (m190627_0005.fits). It is not reduced because it was assigned
the `background` frametype.



Summary
=======

* For the ``arc``, ``tilt``, ``illumflat``, ``pixelflat``, and ``trace`` frames, the user should assign
  the same ``calib`` values of the science data that uses them (or ``all``), while ``comb_id``
  and ``bkg_id`` should be set to ``-1``.
* A common ``comb_id`` should be used for all science frames that the user wishes to co-add before
  spectral extraction.
* A common ``bkg_id`` should be used for all frames that the user wishes to subtract from
  the frames with a common ``comb_id``.
* A unique ``calib`` value should be used for each set of images that the user wants to combine for measuring
  calibrations. It should be an integer <= 63.
* The `background` frametype can be used for images that are only to be used as a background for other `science`
  frames. Images with the `background` frametype will not be reduced.
