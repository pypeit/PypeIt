Implementation Documentation
----------------------------

This module contains the organization scheme for the ``pypeit/data`` files
needed by the ``PypeIt`` package.  Any routine in the package that needs to load
a data file stored in this directory should use the paths supplied by this
module and not call `resource_filename
<https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/pkg_resources.html#resource-extraction>`__
or attempt to otherwise directly access the package directory structure.  In
this way, if structural changes to this directory are needed, only this module
need be modified and the remainder of the package can remain ignorant of those
changes and continue to call the paths supplied by this module.

Furthermore, all paths returned by this module are :obj:`pathlib.Path` objects
rather than pure strings, with all of the functionality therein contained.

Most (by number) of the package data files here are distributed with the
``PypeIt`` package and are accessed via the :class:`~pypeit.data.utils.Paths`
class.  For instance, the NIR spectrophotometry for Vega is accessed via:

.. code-block:: python

    vega_file = data.Paths.standards / 'vega_tspectool_vacuum.dat'

For some directories, however, the size of the included files is large enough
that it was beginning to cause problems with distributing the package via PyPI.
For these specific directories, the data is still stored in the GitHub
repository but is not distributed with the PyPI package.  In order to access
and use these files, we use the AstroPy download/cache system, and specific
functions (``get_*_filepath()``) are required to interact with these files.
Currently, the directories covered by the AstroPy download/cache system are:

    * arc_lines/reid_arxiv
    * skisim
    * sensfuncs

From time to time, it may be necessary to add additional files/directories to
the AstroPy download/cache system.  In this case, there is a particular
sequence of steps required.  The caching routines look for remote-hosted data
files in either the ``develop`` tree or a tagged version tree (e.g., ``1.8.0``)
of the repository, any new files must be already present in the repo before
testing a new ``get_*_filepath()`` routine.  Order of operations is:

    #. Add any new remote-hosted files to the GitHub repo via a separate PR
       that also modifies ``MANIFEST.in`` to exclude these files from the
       distributed package.

    #. Create a new ``get_*_filepath()`` function in this module, following the
       example of one of the existing functions.  Elsewhere in ``PypeIt``, load
       the needed file by invoking the new ``get_*_filepath()`` function.  An
       example of this can be found in ``pypeit/core/flux_calib.py`` where
       ``get_skisim_filepath()`` is called to locate sky transmission files.

If new package-included data are added that are not very large (total directory
size < a few MB), it is not necessary to use the AstroPy cache/download system.
In this case, simply add the directory path to the
:class:`~pypeit.data.utils.Paths` class and access the enclosed files similarly
to the Vega example above.
