def get_delta_wave(wave, wave_gpm, frac_spec_med_filter=0.03):
    r"""
    Compute the change in wavelength per pixel.

    Given an input wavelength vector and an input good pixel mask, the *raw*
    change in wavelength is defined to be ``delta_wave[i] =
    wave[i+1]-wave[i]``, with ``delta_wave[-1] = delta_wave[-2]`` to force
    ``wave`` and ``delta_wave`` to have the same length.

    The method imposes a smoothness on the change in wavelength by (1)
    running a median filter over the raw values and (2) smoothing
    ``delta_wave`` with a Gaussian kernel. The boxsize for the median filter
    is set by ``frac_spec_med_filter``, and the :math:`\sigma` for the
    Gaussian kernel is either a 10th of that boxsize or 3 pixels (whichever
    is larger).

    Parameters
    ---------- 
    wave : float `numpy.ndarray`_, shape = (nspec,)
        Array of input wavelengths. Must be 1D.
    wave_gpm : bool `numpy.ndarray`_, shape = (nspec)
        Boolean good-pixel mask defining where the ``wave`` values are
        good.
    frac_spec_med_filter : :obj:`float`, optional
        Fraction of the length of the wavelength vector to use to median
        filter the raw change in wavelength, used to impose a smoothness.
        Default is 0.03, which means the boxsize for the running median
        filter will be approximately ``0.03*nspec`` (forced to be an odd
        number of pixels).

    Returns
    -------
    delta_wave : `numpy.ndarray`_, float, shape = (nspec,)
        A smooth estimate for the change in wavelength for each pixel in the
        input wavelength vector.

        Peak finding threshold for lines that will be used to create the

    sig_ceil : float, optional, default = 10.0
        Significance threshold for peaks that will be used to determine the line
        amplitude clipping threshold.  For peaks with significance > sig_ceil,
        the code will find the amplitude corresponding to perecent_ceil, and

        Apply a ceiling to the input spectra at the percent_ceil
        percentile level of the distribution of peak amplitudes.
        This prevents extremely strong lines from completely
        dominating the cross-correlation, which can causes the
        cross-correlation to have spurious noise spikes that are not
        the real maximum.
    use_raw_arc : bool, default = False
        If this parameter is True the raw arc will be used rather than the
        continuum subtracted arc
    do_xcorr_arc : bool, default = True
        If this parameter is True, peak finding will be performed and a
        synthetic arc will be created to be used for the cross-correlations.  If
        a synthetic arc has already been created by get_xcorr_arc, then set this

    Determine the shift and stretch of inspec2 relative to inspec1.  This
    routine computes an initial guess for the shift via maximimizing the
    cross-correlation. It then performs a two parameter search for the shift and
    stretch by optimizing the zero lag cross-correlation between the inspec1 and
    the transformed inspec2 (shifted and stretched via
    wvutils.shift_and_stretch()) in a narrow window about the initial estimated
    shift. The convention for the shift is that positive shift means inspec2 is
    shifted to the right (higher pixel values) relative to inspec1. The
    convention for the stretch is that it is float near unity that increases the
    size of the inspec2 relative to the original size (which is the size of
    inspec1)

    Parameters
    ----------
    inspec1 : ndarray
        Reference spectrum
    inspec2 : ndarray
        Spectrum for which the shift and stretch are computed such that it will match inspec1
    cc_thresh: float, default = -1.0
        A number in the range [-1.0,1.0] which is the threshold on the
        initial cross-correlation coefficient for the shift/stretch.  If
        the value of the initial cross-correlation is < cc_thresh the
        code will just exit and return this value and the best shift.
        This is desirable behavior since the shif/stretch optimization
        is slow and this allows one to test how correlated the spectra
        are before attempting it, since there is little value in that
        expensive computation for spectra with little overlap. The
        default cc_thresh =-1.0 means shift/stretch is always attempted
        since the cross correlation coeficcient cannot be less than
        -1.0.
    sigdetect : float, optional, default=3.0
        Peak finding threshold for lines that will be used to create the synthetic xcorr_arc
    sig_ceil : float, optional, default = 10.0
        Significance threshold for peaks that will be used to determine the line amplitude clipping threshold.
        For peaks with significance > sig_ceil, the code will find the amplitude corresponding to
        perecent_ceil, and this will be the clipping threshold.
    percent_ceil: float, default=80.0
        Apply a ceiling to the input spectra at the percent_ceil
        percentile level of the distribution of peak amplitudes.  This
        prevents extremely strong lines from completely dominating the
        cross-correlation, which can causes the cross-correlation to
        have spurious noise spikes that are not the real maximum.
    use_raw_arc: bool, default = False
        If this parameter is True the raw arc will be used rather than the continuum subtracted arc
    shift_mnmx: tuple of floats, default = (-0.05,0.05)
        Range to search for the shift in the optimization about the
        initial cross-correlation based estimate of the shift.  The
        optimization will search the window (shift_cc +
        nspec*shift_mnmx[0],shift_cc + nspec*shift_mnmx[1]) where nspec
        is the number of pixels in the spectrum
    stretch_mnmx: tuple of floats, default = (0.97,1.03)
        Range to search for the stretch in the optimization. The code
        may not work well if this range is significantly expanded
        because the linear approximation used to transform the arc
        starts to break down.
    seed: int or np.random.RandomState, optional, default = None
        Seed for scipy.optimize.differential_evolution optimizer. If not
        specified, the calculation will not be repeatable
    toler : float
        Tolerance for differential evolution optimizaiton.
    debug = False
        Show plots to the screen useful for debugging.

    Returns
    -------
    success: int
        A flag indicating the exit status.  Values are:

          - success = 1, shift and stretch performed via sucessful
            optimization

          - success = 0, shift and stretch optimization failed

          - success = -1, initial x-correlation is below cc_thresh (see
            above), so shift/stretch optimization was not attempted

    shift: float
        the optimal shift which was determined.  If cc_thresh is set,
        and the initial cross-correlation is < cc_thresh,  then this
        will be just the cross-correlation shift
    stretch: float
        the optimal stretch which was determined.  If cc_thresh is set,
        and the initial cross-correlation is < cc_thresh,  then this
        will be just be 1.0
    cross_corr: float
        the value of the cross-correlation coefficient at the optimal
        shift and stretch. This is a number between zero and unity,
        which unity indicating a perfect match between the two spectra.
        If cc_thresh is set, and the initial cross-correlation is <
        cc_thresh, this will be just the initial cross-correlation
    shift_init: float
        The initial shift determined by maximizing the cross-correlation
        coefficient without allowing for a stretch.  If cc_thresh is
        set, and the initial cross-correlation is < cc_thresh, this will
        be just the shift from the initial cross-correlation
    cross_corr_init: float
        The maximum of the initial cross-correlation coefficient
        determined without allowing for a stretch.  If cc_thresh is set,
        and the initial cross-correlation is < cc_thresh, this will be
        just the initial cross-correlation
