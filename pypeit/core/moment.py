def moment1d(flux, col, width, ivar=None, bpm=None, fwgt=None, row=None, weighting='uniform',

    r"""
    Compute one-dimensional moments of the provided image within an
    aperture along its second axis (axis=1).

    This method allows for computations of the zeroth, first, and
    second moments (see `order`). The aperture used for the
    calculation is centered at the provided `col` pixel with a width
    defined by `width`; however, this definition depends on the type
    of weighting applied (see `weighting`). Formulae for each moment
    are as follows. The zeroth moment (`order=0`) computes the
    discrete weighted sum of the flux within the aperture:
    
    .. math::
        \mu_0 &= \sum_i w_i f_i \\
        \epsilon_{\mu_0}^2 &= \sum_i (w_i \epsilon_{f,i})^2,

    where :math:`f` is the flux in each pixel :math:`i`,
    :math:`\epsilon_f` is its error, and :math:`w` is the assigned
    weight (see `weighting`).  The first moment (`order=1`) computes the
    flux-weighted center of window:

    .. math::
        \mu_1 &= \frac{\sum_i x_i w_i f_i }{\mu_0} \\
        \epsilon_{\mu_1}^2 &= \mu_0^{-2}\ \sum_i [ w_i \epsilon_{f,i}\
                            (x_i - \mu_1)]^2,

    where :math:`x` is the pixel position along the 2nd axis (see
    `col`).  The second moment (`order=2`) computes the variance of the
    flux profile about its center within the window:
    
    .. math::
        \mu_2 &= \frac{\sum_i x^2_i w_i f_i }{\mu_0} - \mu_1^2 \\
        \epsilon_{\mu_2}^2 &= \mu_0^{-2}\ \sum_i w^2_i \epsilon^2_{f,i}\
                                [(x_i - \mu_1)^2 + \mu_2]^2.

    The values returned for the second-moment calculation are actually
    the standard deviation instead of the variance, where:

    .. math::
        \sigma = \sqrt{\mu_2} \\
        \epsilon_{\sigma} = \frac{\epsilon_{\mu_2}}{2 \sigma}.

    The method uses `numpy.ma.MaskedArray` objects to keep track of
    math errors, such as divisions by 0. The returned boolean array
    indicates when these errors occurred, and the method replaces
    these errors with the original centers.

    The shape of arrays depend on the shapes of the input image
    (`flux`), columns about which to perform the calculation (`col`),
    and rows from which to select the column data (`row`) as listed
    below.  In the following, the input flux array must be 2D and has
    shape :math:`(N_{\rm row}, N_{\rm col})`, whereas the number of rows
    and columns identified for a moment calculation are :math:`N_{\rm
    mom,row}` and :math:`N_{\rm mom,col}`, respectively.  The possible
    shapes of the output arrays are:

        - If `row` is None and `col` is 1D, the moments are calculated
          centered at each `col` for all rows in `flux`. The shape of
          the array for each moment is then :math:`(N_{\rm row}, N_{\rm
          mom,col})`
        - If `row` is None and `col` is 2D, `col` must have shape
          :math:`(N_{\rm row}, N_{\rm mom,col})` and the shape of the
          output array per moment calculated is the same.
        - If `row` is a single integer and `col` is 1D, the moments are
          calculated for each col only at the provided row in `flux`.
          The shape of the array for each moment is then :math:`(N_{\rm
          mom,col},)`.
        - If `row` is a 1D integer array and `col` is 1D, the default
          behavior is for the moments to be calculated at each col
          for each provided row. The shape of the array for each
          moment would then be :math:`(N_{\rm mom,row},N_{\rm
          mom,col})`. This will be true even if :math:`N_{\rm
          mom,row} = N_{\rm mom,col}`, as long as `mesh` is `True`.
          However, if :math:`N_{\rm mom,row} = N_{\rm mom,col}` and
          `mesh` is `False`, only the matched pairs of `col` and
          `row` will be used and the output shape per moment will be
          :math:`(N_{\rm mom,row},)`.
        - If `row` is a 1D integer array and `col` is 2D, the first axis
          of `col` must be the same length as `row`. The shape of the
          array for each moment is then :math:`(N_{\rm mom,row},N_{\rm
          mom,col})`, which is the same as the input `col`.
        - If `row` is 2D and `col` is 2D, they must have the same shape.
        - If `row` is a single integer and `col` is 2D, or if `row` is
          2D and `col` is 1D, the method raises an error.

    .. note::

        - This is an entirely general function, as reflected by the
          nomenclature used in the call. As used within PypeIt, the
          PypeIt image orientation convention means that moments are
          always taken along the spatial direction; i.e., `col` is
          the spatial coordinate and `row` is the spectral
          coordinate.

        - This function is a generalization of and builds on the
          heritage of functions in idlspec2d, specifically
          trace_fweight, trace_gweight, extrace_asymbox2,
          extract_boxcar.

    .. warning::

        The function has significant setup/input checking. Most of
        this introduces limited overhead with the exception of the
        handling of `ivar`, `bpm`, and `fwgt`. If any of these are
        provided as `None` on input, an array is constructed (unity
        for `ivar` and `fwgt` and all False for `bpm`) that serves as
        a place holder. If repetitive calls to the function are
        expected and any of these arrays are missing, significant
        efficiency gains can be made by providing pre-built values
        for these arrays so that time isn't lost in allocating the
        placeholder arrays in every call.

    .. todo::

        Optimize the code for efficiency, regardless of the input.

    Args:
        flux (`numpy.ndarray`_):
            Intensity image with shape :math:`(N_{\rm row}, N_{\rm
            col})`.
        col (`numpy.ndarray`_):
            Floating-point center along the 2nd axis for the integration
            window in pixel index (first value located at index 0).
            This can either be a 1D or 2D array.  See restrictions on
            the shape in the description above.
        width (:obj:`float`, `numpy.ndarray`_):
            The meaning of the parameter depends on the value of
            `weighting`.  If `weighting=='uniform'`, the width of the
            integration window in columns, centered at the input `col`.
            If `weighting=='gaussian'`, the :math:`\sigma` of a
            pixelated Gaussian weighting function.  The width of the
            integration window in columns, centered at the input `col`,
            is always `6*width` (i.e., the half-width is
            :math:`3\sigma`).  The provided value can be a scalar to use
            a constant window definition, or it can be an array variable
            integration window where the array must have the same shape
            as `col`.
        ivar (`numpy.ndarray`_, optional):
            Inverse variance of the image intensity.  If not provided,
            unity variance is used.  If provided, must have the same
            shape as `flux`.
        bpm (`numpy.ndarray`_, optional):
            Boolean bad-pixel mask for the input image. True values
            are ignored, False values are included. If not provided,
            all pixels are included. If provided, must have the same
            shape as `flux`.
        fwgt (`numpy.ndarray`_, optional):
            An additional weight to apply to each pixel in `flux`.  If
            None, weights are uniform.  Otherwise, the :math:`w_i` from
            above are the product of this weight and the result of the
            scheme set using the `weighting` argument.
        row (:obj:`int`, `numpy.ndarray`_, optional):
            Integer or integer array with the position along the first
            axis (axis=0) for the moment calculation.  This can either
            be None, an integer, or a 1D or 2D array.  See restrictions
            on the shape in the description above.
        weighting (:obj:`str`, optional):
            The weighting to apply to the position within each
            integration window (see `width` above). This must be
            (case-insensitive) either 'uniform' for uniform weighting or
            'gaussian' for weighting by a Gaussian centered at the input
            guess coordinates and integrated over the pixel width.
        order (:obj:`int`, array-like, optional):
            The order of the moment(s) to calculate. Can be a single
            integer or a list. Moments to calculate must be 0, 1, or
            2; at most order can be `[0,1,2]`. The shape of the
            output arrays depends on the number of moments
            calculated. Note that the calculation of the orders is
            necessarily sequential; i.e., setting `order=2` means
            that the zeroth and first moments have to be calculated
            anyway. The order must be provided in sorted order; i.e.,
            you cannot pass `order=[2,1]`.
        bounds (:obj:`tuple`, optional):
            A two-tuple with the lower and upper limit for each
            moment order. If None, no bounds are imposed. If not
            None, an upper and lower bound must be provided for each
            moment to compute; i.e., if more than one moment is
            computed, each element of the two-tuple must be an
            array-like object that matches the length of `order`. To
            set an upper or lower bound only, set the unbounded
            component to None. Bounds for the zeroth and second order
            moments are in an absolute sense, whereas first-order
            bounds are relative to the input `col`. Measurements that
            hit the bounds are masked; see the description of the
            returned objects. For example, to flag anything without a
            positive zeroth moment or a maximum shift from the input
            center of 1 pixel, call the method with arguments::

                order=[0,1], bounds=([0,-1], [None,1])
            
        fill_error (:obj:`float`, optional):
            Value to use as filler for undetermined moments,
            resulting from either the input bad-pixel mask or
            computational issues (division by zero, etc.; see return
            description below).
        mesh (:obj:`bool`, optional):
            If `col` and `row` are 1D vectors of the same length,
            this determines if each `col` and `row` should be paired
            (`mesh is False`) or used to construct a grid, i.e.,
            every `col` combined with every `row` (`mesh is True`).
            See the method description.

    Returns:
        Three `numpy.ndarray`_ objects are returned. If more than one
        moment order is requested, the moments are ordered along the
        first axis; e.g., if `order=[0,1]` the outputs `moment[0]` and
        `moment[1]` contain the zeroth and first moments, respectively.
        The subsequent dimensions of the output arrays are dictated by
        the input `row` and `col`; see the method description. The
        returned arrays are:

            - The moment calculated along the 2nd axis of the input
              image (axis=1).  Masked values (indicated by the third
              object returned) are 0 for the zeroth and second moments
              and equal to the input `col` value for the first moments.
            - The formal propagated error (see equations above) in the
              moments.  Errors are only meaningful if `ivar` is
              provided. Masked values (indicated by the third object
              returned) are set to `fill_error`.
            - A boolean bad-pixel mask for output data; True values
              should be ignored, False values are valid measurements.

    Raises:
        ValueError:
            Raised if input shapes are not correct or if the selected
            `weighting` is unknown.  See method description.

        >>> from scipy.special import erf
        >>> def gauss_comb():
        ...     c = [45,50,55]
        ...     img = np.zeros((len(c),100), dtype=float)
        ...     x = np.arange(100)
        ...     sig = 5.
        ...     for i,_c in enumerate(c):
        ...         img[i,:] = (erf((x-c[i]+0.5)/np.sqrt(2)/sig) 
        ...                         - erf((x-c[i]-0.5)/np.sqrt(2)/sig))/2.
        ...     return img
        ...
        >>> img = gauss_comb()

        Calculate all moments at one column and row:

        Calculate zeroth moments in all rows centered at column 50
        
        >>> moment1d(img, 50, 40., order=0)[0]

               [0.97670951, 0.99858297, 0.99993125]])

        Calculate first moments in all rows for the three column positions

        array([[45.        , 45.02314924, 45.2814655 ],
               [49.97685076, 50.        , 50.02314924],
               [54.7185345 , 54.97685076, 55.        ]])

        Or pick the same column for all rows
        
        >>> moment1d(img, 50, 40., row=[0,1,2], order=1)[0]
        array([45.02314924, 50.        , 54.97685076])
