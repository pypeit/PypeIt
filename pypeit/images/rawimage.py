class RawImage:
    """
    Class to load and process raw images.

    Generally speaking, this class should only be used as follows:

    .. code-block:: python

        # Load the raw data and prepare the object
        rawImage = RawImage(file, spectrograph, det)
        pypeitImage = rawImage.process(par)

    modulo details of the keyword arguments in
    :func:`~pypeit.images.rawimage.RawImage.process`.  The class has many
    methods that handle each step of the processing but the order of these steps
    matters, meaning they're not guaranteed to succeed if done out of order.
    This is most relevant when processing multiple detector images into an image
    mosaic; see :func:`process`.

    Args:
        ifile (:obj:`str`):
            File with the data.
        spectrograph (:class:`~pypeit.spectrographs.spectrograph.Spectrograph`):
            The spectrograph from which the data was collected.
        det (:obj:`int`, :obj:`tuple`):
            1-indexed detector(s) to read.  An image mosaic is selected using a
            :obj:`tuple` with the detectors in the mosaic, which must be one of
            the allowed mosaics returned by
            :func:`~pypeit.spectrographs.spectrograph.Spectrograph.allowed_mosaics`.

    Attributes:
        filename (:obj:`str`):
            Original file name with the data.
        spectrograph (:class:`~pypeit.spectrographs.spectrograph.Spectrograph`):
            Spectrograph instance with the instrument-specific properties and
            methods.
        det (:obj:`int`, :obj:`tuple`):
            1-indexed detector number(s); see class argument.
        detector (:class:`~pypeit.images.detector_container.DetectorContainer`, :class:`~pypeit.images.mosaic.Mosaic`):
            Mosaic/Detector characteristics
        rawimage (`numpy.ndarray`_):
            The raw, not trimmed or reoriented, image data for the detector(s).
        hdu (`astropy.io.fits.HDUList`_):
            The full list of HDUs provided by :attr:`filename`.
        exptime (:obj:`float`):
            Frame exposure time in seconds.
        rawdatasec_img (`numpy.ndarray`_):
            The original, not trimmed or reoriented, image identifying which
            amplifier was used to read each section of the raw image.
        oscansec_img (`numpy.ndarray`_):
            The original, not trimmed or reoriented, image identifying the
            overscan regions in the raw image read by each amplifier.
        headarr (:obj:`list`):
            A list of `astropy.io.fits.Header`_ objects with the headers for all
            extensions in :attr:`hdu`.
        image (`numpy.ndarray`_):
            The processed image.  This starts as identical to :attr:`rawimage`
            and then altered by the processing steps; see :func:`process`.
        ronoise (:obj:`list`):
            The readnoise (in e-/ADU) for each of the detector amplifiers.
        par (:class:`~pypeit.par.pypeitpar.ProcessImagesPar`):
            Parameters that dictate the processing of the images.
        ivar (`numpy.ndarray`_):
            The inverse variance of :attr:`image`, the processed image.
        rn2img (`numpy.ndarray`_):
            The readnoise variance image.
        proc_var (`numpy.ndarray`_):
            The sum of the variance components added by the image processing;
            i.e., the error in the overscan subtraction, bias subtraction, etc.
        base_var (`numpy.ndarray`_):
            The base-level variance in the processed image.  See
            :func:`~pypeit.core.procimg.base_variance`.
        var (`numpy.ndarray`_):
            The aggregate variance in the processed image.  This is the primary
            array used during :func:`process` to track uncertainties;
            :attr:`ivar` is created by inverting this at the end of the
            processing method.
        steps (:obj:`dict`):
            Dictionary containing a set of booleans that track the processing
            steps that have been performed.
        datasec_img (`numpy.ndarray`_):
            Image identifying which amplifier was used to read each section of
            the *processed* image.
        spat_flexure_shift (:obj:`float`):
            The spatial flexure shift in pixels, if calculated

            #. :func:`subtract_bias`: Subtract the processed bias image.  The
               shape and orientation of the bias image must match the
               *processed* image.  I.e., if you trim and orient this image, you
               must also have trimmed and oriented the bias frames.

            #. :func:`build_dark`: Create dark-current images using both the
               tabulated dark-current value for each detector and any directly
               observed dark images.  The shape and orientation of the observed
               dark image must match the *processed* image.  I.e., if you trim
               and orient this image, you must also have trimmed and oriented
               the dark frames.  To scale the dark image by the ratio of the
               exposure times to ensure the counts/s in the dark are removed
               from the image being processed, set the ``dark_expscale``
               parameter to true.

            #. :func:`subtract_dark`: Subtract the processed dark image and
               propagate any error.

            #. :func:`build_mosaic`: If data from multiple detectors are being
               processed as components of a detector mosaic, this resamples the
               individual images into a single image mosaic.  The current
               "resampling" scheme is restricted to nearest grid-point
               interpolation; see .  The placement of this step is important in that
               all of the previous corrections (overscan, trim, orientation,
               bias- and dark-subtraction) are done on the individual detector
               images.  However, after this point, we potentially need the slits
               and flat-field images which are *only defined in the mosaic
               frame*.  Because of this, bias and dark frames should *never* be
               reformatted into a mosaic.

            #. :func:`spatial_flexure_shift`: Measure any spatial shift due to
               flexure.

            #. :func:`flatfield`: Divide by the pixel-to-pixel, spatial and
               spectral response functions.

            #. :func:`build_ivar`: Construct a model estimate of the variance in
               the image based in the readnoise, errors from the additive
               processing steps, shot-noise from the observed counts (see the
               ``shot_noise`` parameter), a rescaling due to the flat-field
               correction, and a noise floor that sets a maximum S/N per pixel
               (see the ``noise_floor`` parameter); see

        calculated in the native detector frame.  Because ``img_scale`` is only
        related to the flat-field images, it is not remapped because these
